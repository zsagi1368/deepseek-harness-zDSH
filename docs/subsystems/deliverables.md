# Deliverables

English | [中文](deliverables.zh.md)

What a turn hands to the user, owned by the [deliverables package group](../../packages/deliverables/README.md): the files the model declared through the `present` tool, recorded in a log-only Session event, and the files the turn changed, summarized from git working-tree snapshots taken at turn start and turn end plus whole-file captures around each file-tool edit for the paths git does not cover, announced by a log-only event and served by a Host service while the Session lives together with each listed file's turn-start and turn-end comparison. Only clients read them; the Web [deliverables plugin](../../packages/client/ui-deliverables/README.md) renders both at the end of the turn. Tool behavior, snapshot mechanics, and configuration are on the package READMEs for [`tool-present`](../../packages/deliverables/tool-present/README.md) and [`workspace-changes`](../../packages/deliverables/workspace-changes/README.md).

Sources: [`packages/deliverables/tool-present/src/types.ts`](../../packages/deliverables/tool-present/src/types.ts), [`packages/deliverables/workspace-changes/src/types.ts`](../../packages/deliverables/workspace-changes/src/types.ts)

## `PresentedFile` — one declared delivery

```ts type-equiv
/** A declared filesystem file whose current contents remain at its source path. */
interface PresentedFile {
  /** Original absolute path or path relative to the Session working directory. */
  path: string
  /** Optional description supplied by the model. */
  description?: string
}
```

## `WorkspaceChangedFile` — one changed file

```ts type-equiv
/** One file changed during a turn, with line counts from git or from the whole-file captures around its file-tool edits. */
interface WorkspaceChangedFile {
  /** Path relative to the Session working directory, or an absolute Host path outside it. */
  path: string
  /**
   * Sort key and label: the relative path inside the working directory, a
   * `../` path for repository files above it, a `~` path under the home
   * directory, otherwise the absolute path. Always slash-separated.
   */
  display: string
  /** Lines added; zero for a binary or oversized file. */
  added: number
  /** Lines deleted; zero for a binary or oversized file. */
  deleted: number
  /** Present when git reported the file as binary, or when a captured side holds a NUL byte. */
  binary?: true
  /** Present when a captured side exceeded the plugin's `maxFileBytes`; the file is listed without counts or comparison. */
  oversized?: true
}
```

## `WorkspaceChangesSummary` — one turn's change summary

```ts type-equiv
/** Files changed during one top-level turn, kept on the Host until its Session is disposed. */
interface WorkspaceChangesSummary {
  /** The turn whose file changes this summary describes. */
  turn: number
  /** The Session working directory `path` values are relative to. */
  cwd: string
  /** Changed files in `display` order, capped at the plugin's `maxFiles`. */
  files: WorkspaceChangedFile[]
  /** Complete changed-file count, including files omitted by the cap. */
  total: number
  /** Lines added over every changed file, including files omitted by the cap. */
  added: number
  /** Lines deleted over every changed file, including files omitted by the cap. */
  deleted: number
  /** Git tree ids of the turn-start and turn-end snapshots; absent when no snapshot was taken. */
  snapshot?: { before: string; after: string }
}
```

## `WorkspaceDiffHunk` — one unified-diff hunk

```ts type-equiv
/** One unified-diff hunk with three context lines; every line keeps its `+`, `-`, or space prefix. */
interface WorkspaceDiffHunk {
  /** First line of the hunk in the turn-start content, 1-based; a side without lines starts at 1 with zero lines. */
  oldStart: number
  /** Lines of the hunk taken from the turn-start content. */
  oldLines: number
  /** First line of the hunk in the turn-end content, 1-based; a side without lines starts at 1 with zero lines. */
  newStart: number
  /** Lines of the hunk taken from the turn-end content. */
  newLines: number
  /** Hunk body in order, each line prefixed with `+`, `-`, or a space. */
  lines: string[]
}
```

## `WorkspaceFileDiff` — one file's comparison

```ts type-equiv
/** The comparison of one listed file's turn-start and turn-end contents, computed when asked for. */
type WorkspaceFileDiff =
  | {
    kind: 'text'
    /** The listed file's `path`. */
    path: string
    /** The listed file's `display`. */
    display: string
    /** Whether the file existed at turn start. */
    before: boolean
    /** Whether the file existed at turn end. */
    after: boolean
    /** Hunks in file order; empty when both sides hold the same lines. */
    hunks: WorkspaceDiffHunk[]
    /** True when the line comparison exceeded the plugin's `diffTimeoutMs` and every line is shown as replaced. */
    coarse: boolean
  }
  /** A side git reported as binary or that holds a NUL byte; no lines are served. */
  | { kind: 'binary'; path: string; display: string }
  /** A side larger than the plugin's `maxFileBytes`; no lines are served. */
  | { kind: 'oversized'; path: string; display: string }
```

## `WorkspaceChanges` — the Host service serving summaries and comparisons

```ts type-equiv
/** Serves the summaries and file comparisons the recorder keeps for live Sessions. */
interface WorkspaceChanges {
  /**
   * The summary announced by one `workspace/changes` event.
   * @param sessionId - the Session that appended the event.
   * @param seq - the event's sequence number.
   * @returns the summary, or undefined once its Session was disposed or when this Host never recorded it.
   */
  summary(sessionId: SessionId, seq: number): WorkspaceChangesSummary | undefined
  /**
   * Compare one listed file's contents at turn start and turn end.
   * @param sessionId - the Session that appended the event.
   * @param seq - the event's sequence number.
   * @param index - the file's index in the summary's `files`.
   * @param signal - cancels the reads.
   * @returns the comparison, or undefined once its Session was disposed, when this Host never recorded it, or when no file has that index.
   * @throws when a snapshot read fails for a live Session.
   */
  diff(sessionId: SessionId, seq: number, index: number, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<WorkspaceFileDiff | undefined>
}
```

## Durable events and the served summary

`tool-present` declaration-merges `deliverables/presented: { turn; callId; files: PresentedFile[] }` into `SessionEventMap`, appended once per successful final `present` result. `workspace-changes` merges `workspace/changes: { turn }`, appended when a top-level turn stops; the summary that event announced is not in the log but is returned by `workspaceChanges.summary(sessionId, seq)` for the event's sequence until the Session is disposed, so a conversation reopened after a Host restart has no changed-files card for its earlier turns. `workspaceChanges.diff(sessionId, seq, index, signal)` compares one listed file on the same terms. A later event for the same turn replaces the earlier one, so a client keeps only the latest. The generated [persistence catalog](../persistence-catalog.md#deliverablespresented--log-only) records both declaration sites. Neither event reaches the model.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.workspaceChanges` — `WorkspaceChanges`

Serves the summaries and file comparisons the recorder keeps for live Sessions.

 * @param sessionId - the Session that appended the event.
 * @param seq - the event's sequence number.

 */
summary(sessionId: SessionId, seq: number): WorkspaceChangesSummary | undefined

/**
 * Compare one listed file's contents at turn start and turn end.
 * @param sessionId - the Session that appended the event.

 * @param signal - cancels the reads.
 * @returns the comparison, or undefined once its Session was disposed, when this Host never recorded it, or when no file has that index.
