# Typert remote calls

English | [中文](typert.zh.md)

Types shared by generated Remote artifacts, the Host Gateway, and consumer API assemblies. The [Typert Gateway Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-02-typert-remote-method-calls.md) owns the architecture and transport decisions; this page records the literal public contracts from [`dsh-typert-protocol`](../../packages/typert/protocol/src/types.ts) and [`dsh-api-gateway`](../../packages/api/gateway/src/types.ts).

## Lookup and Context declarations

Business-object packages extend two empty maps through declaration merging. A lookup associates one Host object type with its wire identity; a Context declaration associates one scoped Context kind with its wire identity. Generated descriptors name these keys, while runtime providers supply the live resolution behavior.

```ts type-equiv
/** Merge-extensible Host object lookup declarations. */
interface TypertLookupMap {}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Merge-extensible scoped Context declarations. */
interface TypertContextMap {}
```

The registry retains a lookup's wire declaration after its resolver unloads. SRC discovery therefore continues to classify the parameter as a lookup and fails unavailable instead of accepting the wire value as an ordinary business object.

```ts type-equiv
/** Stable wire declaration retained after a lookup provider unloads. */
interface TypertLookupDefinition {
  /** Merge-declared lookup key. */
  readonly key: string
  /** Source parameter name recognized by the SRC weak parser. */
  readonly parameter: string
  /** Wire field replacing the Host object parameter. */
  readonly wire: string
  /** Canonical Host type symbol used by strict generation. */
  readonly hostTypeSymbol: string
  /** Canonical wire type symbol used by strict generation. */
  readonly wireTypeSymbol: string
}
```

## Invocation descriptors

An `InvocationDescriptor` is local reflection, not a wire message. Host and consumer builds generate corresponding descriptors; the request sends only the endpoint and named `args`. Strict codecs carry generated schema factories, while SRC codecs enforce JSON-safe inputs without structural type recovery. Unary result codecs can supply `encode()` for byte-containing subtrees and `decode()` for recursive native-byte validation; Client declarations narrow every `Uint8Array` to `ArrayBuffer` backing. Pure JSON results need neither byte detection nor Client decoding. Cancellation is an out-of-band carrier signal injected after business parameters and never enters `args`.

```ts type-equiv
/** Codec attached to one invocation parameter or result. */
type TypertCodec =
  | {
    readonly mode: 'strict'
    readonly typeSymbol: string
    /** Materialize and return the process-realm schema on first boundary use. */
    readonly create: () => TypertSchema
    /**
     * Decode a unary result whose fields require type-specific handling.
     * @param value - result reconstructed by the RPC carrier.
     * @returns the validated result, retaining native byte views.
     */
    readonly decode?: (value: unknown) => unknown
    /**
     * Project typed binary fields into RPC result attachments.
     * @param value - native unary result.
     * @param writeBytes - records a byte view at its result-relative path and returns its JSON placeholder.
     * @returns JSON metadata with untouched JSON subtrees retained.
     */
    readonly encode?: (value: unknown, writeBytes: (bytes: Uint8Array, path: readonly (string | number)[]) => null) => unknown
  }
  | {
    readonly mode: 'src-json'
  }
```

```ts type-equiv
/** One ordered business parameter in a Remote invocation. */
interface InvocationParameterDescriptor {
  /** Source-level parameter name. */
  readonly name: string
  /** Required key in the wire `args` object. */
  readonly wire: string
  /** Whether the value is JSON or requires a registered Host lookup. */
  readonly source: 'json' | 'lookup'
  /** Lookup key when `source` is `lookup`. */
  readonly lookup?: string
  /** Boundary codec for the wire representation. */
  readonly codec: TypertCodec
  /** Missing wire fields decode to `undefined` only for an explicitly declared `T | undefined`. */
  readonly acceptsUndefined?: true
}
```

```ts type-equiv

    /** Context kind whose Client adapter supplies the identity. */

    /** Lookup parameter wire field replaced by the Context identity. */
    readonly wire: string
  }
  /** Ordered business parameters. */
  readonly parameters: readonly InvocationParameterDescriptor[]
  /**
   * Client-to-Host items of the same logical stream, generated from the `In`
   * type argument of the method's `RemoteStream<Out, In>` return type; absent
   * when `In` is `never`. The method reads the items through
   * `RemoteInvocation.uplink()`, so nothing enters the parameter list.
   */
  readonly uplink?: {
    /** Codec validating every uplink item before `uplink()` delivers it. */
    readonly codec: TypertCodec
  }
  /** Transport cancellation injected after business parameters instead of entering wire args. */
  readonly cancellation?: {
    /** Reserved final Host method parameter. */
    readonly parameter: 'signal'
  }
  /** Codec for the unary result or each yielded stream item. */
  readonly result: TypertCodec
  /** Source declaration used only for diagnostics. */
  readonly sourceLocation?: InvocationSourceLocation
}
```

The Host alias `RemoteStream<Out, In>` names both directions of one stream, and the receiving method reads its call context as `this.ctx.invocation`:

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One Remote stream as a Host method returns it: the items it yields to the
 * Client, iterated as a plain `AsyncIterable<Out>`. `In` is the type of the
 * items the Client may send back on the same logical stream, read through
 * `RemoteInvocation.uplink()`; it is carried only as a type-level marker. The
 * default `never` declares a method that reads none, and its descriptor
 * carries no uplink codec. A generated Client stream method returns the same
 * stream as a `RemoteStreamHandle<Out, In>`.
 * @template Out - item type the Host method yields.
 * @template In - item type the Client may send; `never` when the method reads none.
 */
type RemoteStream<Out, In = never> = AsyncIterable<Out> & { readonly [STREAM_UPLINK]?: In }
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One open Remote stream as the Client holds it: the downlink items as an
 * `AsyncIterable`, plus the uplink and cancellation of the same logical
 * stream. A generated Client stream method returns it, and calling that
 * method opens the stream: a holder that neither iterates nor disposes the
 * handle keeps the Host stream alive. A handle stands for one generation:
 * when the carrier is lost, iteration fails with the carrier error and the
 * handle is finished.
 * @template Out - item type the Host method yields.
 * @template In - item type the Client may send; `never` when the method reads none.
 */
interface RemoteStreamHandle<Out, In> extends AsyncIterable<Out> {
  /**
   * Send one uplink item. Items sent before the stream has opened are queued
   * and sent once the `open` frame is on the wire. A top-level `undefined`

  end(): void
  /**

## Typert registry

`ctx.typert` separates current-environment descriptors, explicitly selected Remote contributions, lookup providers, and scoped Context providers. A lookup provider owns the stable wire declaration and default resolver; Host composition can configure an effect-scoped synchronous or asynchronous resolver for the same key, and unloading that configuration restores the default policy. Registrations are Cordis-owned effects and return awaitable disposers.

```ts type-equiv
/** Minimal Typert runtime consumed through dependency inversion. */
interface TypertRegistryContract {
  readonly local: TypertLocalRegistry
  readonly remotes: TypertRemoteRegistry
  readonly lookups: TypertLookupRegistry
  readonly contexts: TypertContextRegistry
}
```

Generated consumer declarations merge direct namespaces into the map inherited by `TypertClientRemote`.

```ts type-equiv
/** Merge-extensible direct namespace surface generated for Client Remote services. */
interface TypertRemoteNamespaceMap {}
```

## Host Gateway

Connection decodes its carrier envelope before calling `ctx.typertGateway`. The request carries exact named wire fields and the carrier's cancellation signal separately; infrastructure and boundary failures ride `TypertGatewayError`, whose `gateway/*` codes are ordinary `RemoteError` codes, so the RPC adapter passes every structurally identified `RemoteError` through with its code and details intact and folds only unrecognized exceptions into `gateway/internal`.

```ts type-equiv
/** One Remote method request after a carrier has decoded its envelope. */
interface InvokeRemoteRequest {
  /** Remote namespace selected by the generated descriptor. */
  readonly namespace: string
  /** Exported Service method name. */
  readonly method: string
  /** Named wire values; fields must exactly match the descriptor. */
  readonly args: Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>
  /**
   * Client uplink items of this logical stream, delivered to the method through
   * `invocation.uplink()`; absent means an immediately ended iterable.
   */
  readonly uplink?: AsyncIterable<unknown>
  /** Peer the call speaks for; absent means an in-process carrier, answered as the operator. */
  readonly peer?: PeerScope
  /** Carrier or direct-caller cancellation injected only into cancellation-aware methods. */
  readonly signal?: AbortSignal
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Stable infrastructure and boundary failures emitted before or after business execution. */
type TypertGatewayErrorCode =
  | 'gateway/ambiguous-endpoint'
  | 'gateway/arguments-invalid'
  | 'gateway/binding-invalid'
  | 'gateway/context-failed'
  | 'gateway/context-not-found'

   */
  registerRemoteEvents(
    source: TypertRemoteEventSource,
    host: RemoteEventHostInfo,
  ): () => Promise<void>
  /**
   * Invoke one live Remote method without assuming a carrier or response envelope.
   * @param request - decoded endpoint and named wire arguments.
   * @returns the business result without output decoding.
   * @throws {@link TypertGatewayError} for dispatch, provider, or boundary failures; lookup-policy and business errors retain identity.
   */
  invoke(request: InvokeRemoteRequest): Promise<unknown>
  /**
   * Open one live stream Remote method without assuming a physical carrier.
   * @param request - decoded endpoint, named wire arguments, and the Client uplink when the carrier has one.
   * @returns a cancellation-aware iterable over the business results.
   */
  stream(request: InvokeRemoteRequest): Promise<AsyncIterable<unknown>>
}
```

## Consumer Remote

`ctx.remote` exposes only namespaces contributed by imported `/remote` artifacts. `$mount()` installs generated descriptors and concrete methods as one fiber-owned operation. Each namespace is a traced `remote.<namespace>` Cordis child Service whose lifetime spans its mounted methods; no JavaScript Proxy or Host business Service type enters the consumer.

```ts type-equiv
/** Client Remote capability implemented by the Gateway and consumed by Remote assemblies. */
interface TypertClientRemote extends TypertRemoteNamespaceMap {
  /**
   * Mount one generated Host-for-Client contribution in the caller's fiber.
   * @param contribution - explicitly selected Remote package artifact.
   * @returns disposer after namespace services and concrete methods are ready.
   */
  $mount(contribution: TypertRemoteContribution): Promise<TypertDisposer>
  /**
   * Subscribe to one forwarded Host event. Notifications run in registration
   * order and isolate failures; scoped waterfalls return, delegate through
   * `next()`, or reject the Host dispatch.
   * @template Event - forwarded event name selected by the Host assembly.
   * @param event - forwarded Host event name, unchanged on the wire.
   * @param listener - receives the Client projection of the Cordis `Events` declaration.
   * @returns disposer owned by the calling fiber.
   */
  $on<Event extends TypertRemoteEvent>(event: Event, listener: TypertClientEventListener<Event>): () => void
}
```
