# Workspaces

English | [中文](workspace.zh.md)

A workspace is the persistent record of a directory the user works in: a stable id over a canonical path, a display title, and the ordered account of sessions that belong to it. The subsystem is one package ([dsh-workspace](../../packages/workspace/workspace), `ctx.workspaceRegistry`) — an optional host-side capability, not part of the agent-loop spine, and invisible to models (no tools, no prompt text, no session events). It stores its records through the [storage domain form](storage.md) and validates session membership against [`SessionHeader.cwd`](persistence.md#sessionheader--metadata-beside-the-log), so `storageDomain` and `sessionPersistence` are mandatory startup dependencies: an unavailable persistence peer leaves the plugin pending rather than being mistaken for an empty history. Design record: [domain KV storage Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/proposed/architecture/2026-07-24-domain-kv-storage-and-workspace.md); bootstrap and GUI ordering: [Workspace UI product-flow Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/archived/feature/2026-07-25-workspace-ui-product-flow.md).

## Identity

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Identifies one workspace record. A generated uuid, never the path: path
 * normalization rewrites paths, and a reference anchor must stay stable.
 */
type WorkspaceId = Branded<'WorkspaceId'>
```

`WorkspaceId` is a [branded id](core.md#branded-ids). Path identity is separate: `realpathNormalize` (`fs.realpath`; trailing slashes, `..`, and symlinks resolved) is the one uniqueness canon — workspace paths are stored canonicalized, uniqueness is string equality of canonical paths (a symlink to an owned directory collides), and attach-time session cwd checks go through the same canon.

## The workspace entity

Consumers see only the `Workspace` interface; the implementation stays package-private.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One workspace: a stable id over an existing directory, a display title, and
 * an ordered candidate account of sessions. Membership requires both an id in
 * that account and a session header whose canonical cwd equals the workspace
 * path. Consumers only see this interface; the implementation stays private.
 */
interface Workspace {
  /** Stable record id (generated uuid). */
  readonly id: WorkspaceId

  /**
   * Canonical directory path: the `fs.realpath` of the path given at create
   * time (trailing slashes, `..`, and symlinks all resolved). Never rewritten
   * afterwards, even when the directory disappears (see {@link status}).
   */
  readonly path: string

  /** Display title. Defaults to the final path segment, or a filesystem root's own spelling; duplicates are allowed. */
  readonly title: string

  /** ISO-8601 creation instant, stamped at create and never rewritten. */
  readonly createdAt: string

  /** ISO-8601 instant of the last durable mutation (create counts as one). */
  readonly updatedAt: string

  /**
   * Header-validated sessions in manually owned order: a new session is
   * prepended at attach, explicit reordering goes through
   * `insertSessionBefore`, and activity never reorders. The durable candidate
   * account is filtered synchronously: missing headers, invalid cwd values,
   * and canonical cwd mismatches are never returned. A subsequent workspace
   * mutation prunes those filtered candidates durably.
   */
  readonly sessionIds: readonly SessionId[]

  /**
   * Replace the display title durably.
   * @param title - New title; any string, duplicates across workspaces allowed.
   * @returns resolution after durability.
   */
  setTitle(title: string): Promise<void>

  /**
   * Prepend a session to this workspace's candidate account. An already
   * accounted id resolves without writing, aside from the durable
   * filtered-candidate prune every accepted mutation performs. A new id's
   * live or persisted
   * header cwd must resolve to an existing directory equal to {@link path};
   * unknown ids, missing or invalid cwd values, and mismatches reject without
   * writing.
   * @param sessionId - The session to record.
   * @returns resolution after durability.
   */
  attachSession(sessionId: SessionId): Promise<void>

  /**
   * Move an accounted session within the manual order, DOM-insertBefore-like:
   * with an anchor the session lands before it, without one it appends to the
   * end. Only the moved id changes position. A session or anchor absent from
   * the account rejects without writing; a move to the current position
   * resolves without writing, aside from the durable filtered-candidate
   * prune every accepted mutation performs; decided on the domain write
   * chain.
   * @param sessionId - The accounted session to move.
   * @param beforeSessionId - Accounted anchor to insert before; omitted appends.
   * @returns resolution after durability.
   */
  insertSessionBefore(sessionId: SessionId, beforeSessionId?: SessionId): Promise<void>

  /**
   * Remove a session from this workspace's account. Idempotent: an id not on
   * the account resolves without writing, aside from the durable
   * filtered-candidate prune every accepted mutation performs; decided on
   * the domain write chain like attach. Never touches the session's own stored log.
   * @param sessionId - The session to remove.
   * @returns resolution after durability.
   */
  detachSession(sessionId: SessionId): Promise<void>

  /**
   * Live directory check, uncached: whether {@link path} currently exists and
   * is a directory. A missing directory never mutates the record — the
   * directory may only be temporarily moved.
   * @returns `'ok'` when the directory exists, `'missing-dir'` otherwise.
   */
  status(): Promise<'ok' | 'missing-dir'>
}
```

Ownership truth is the record's ordered `sessionIds`, never derived from session cwd — but membership requires both: an id on the account and a header whose canonical cwd equals the workspace path, so one session structurally belongs to at most one workspace. Failed writes reject (`insertSessionBefore` account errors as `WorkspaceMoveInvalidError`, storage failures as plain errors); every accepted mutation stamps `updatedAt` and durably prunes candidates that no longer pass the membership check.

## The registry: `ctx.workspaceRegistry`

`WorkspaceRegistry` ([signatures](#ctxworkspaceregistry--workspaceregistry)) owns registration and resolution. `create(path, title?)` requires a fully qualified path, canonicalizes it, rejects a nonexistent path (the original `ENOENT`) or a non-directory, returns the existing entity unchanged when the canonical path is already owned, and otherwise creates a record with `title ?? defaultWorkspaceTitle(path)` prepended to the durable registry order (different canonical paths may share a display title, and a path with no final segment uses its root spelling). `get(id)` and the ordered `list()` are synchronous cache reads; `resolveByPath(path)` applies the same fully qualified realpath canon without creating. `delete(id)` removes only the registration, order entry, and session account — the directory, user files, live sessions, and persisted logs are never touched, so those sessions become Ungrouped ([decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-07-27-workspace-registration-deletion.md)); unknown ids return `false`. Create and delete persist a pending-mutation marker before their two writes (record + order) can diverge; startup resolves exactly the marked mutation — by deleting the marked table row, which completes an interrupted delete and rolls back an interrupted create (the registration is re-creatable, so rollback is the safe direction) — and an unmarked order/table mismatch fails loud as corruption.

Sessions get their cwd at create time from whoever creates them, not from this registry — the API gateway resolves a new session's cwd from the chosen workspace's `path` (falling back to an explicit or default cwd), creates the session so the cwd lands in its immutable [`SessionHeader`](persistence.md#sessionheader--metadata-beside-the-log), then calls `attachSession`, which re-validates that stored header cwd against the workspace path. On the first successful start, the registry bootstraps history from persisted headers alone (`id`, `cwd`, `createdAt` — never event bodies), grouping sessions with a valid canonical cwd into per-directory workspaces, newest first; the initialized marker is written last so an interrupted bootstrap resumes safely. The bootstrap is one-time: cwd-less legacy sessions stay Ungrouped, and sessions created afterwards join a workspace only through `attachSession`.

## Default Workspace initialization

The controller's `initializeDefault` takes no request: it owns the fixed `default-workspace` directory name, resolves the Documents location, and asks the registry to initialize once. The registry accepts a directory resolver, derives the initial title from the requested directory's final segment rather than the canonical one, and commits the registration with its durable identity. No language reaches the Host — browser consumers label a Workspace still carrying that automatic title through the controller's `workspaceDisplayTitle`, so only the on-screen name follows the reader's language. [First-use behavior and configuration](../../packages/api/workspace-controller/README.md#first-use-workspace) describe reuse and failure handling.

## Session pinning

The controller's [transport types](../../packages/api/workspace-controller/src/types.ts) define `WorkspacePinSessionRequest` and `WorkspaceUnpinSessionRequest`, each carrying one `sessionId`. Both operations return `WorkspacePinValue`: the complete `pinnedSessionIds` array of Session ids, most recently pinned first. Pinning requires a known, unarchived Session; unpinning an id that is not pinned succeeds without changing the set. Archiving removes the Session's pin in the same durable write, and unarchiving does not restore it.

## Archive admission

Archiving is a registry-global durable set, and the registry refuses to hide running work behind it. The rule is a capability seam over two Host events the package declares and dispatches ([events](#workspace-events)): `workspace/session-activity` (waterfall) asks the composed providers what still runs for a Session, and `workspace/session-stop` (parallel) asks them to stop it. Each provider registers on the root like any listener, so the package knows no agent, job, or schedule vocabulary; the families are keys of a merge-extensible map.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Activity families a `workspace/session-activity` listener may report. This
 * package declares none: each provider merges its own key from a module both
 * its Host and Client faces import, so a consumer that renders the families
 * sees exactly the keys its program compiled and falls through to a generic
 * description for any other. The shipped providers merge `turn` (the Agent
 * registry), `job` (the job registry seam), `subagent` (the Subagent
 * runtime), and `schedule` (the Schedule plugin).
 */
interface SessionActivityKindMap {}
```

`SessionActivityKind` is `keyof SessionActivityKindMap`, so a program that compiled no provider sees no key at all. The shipped keys live in client-importable type modules: `turn` in the Agent registry's `types.ts`, `job` in the job registry seam's `view.ts`, `subagent` in the Subagent runtime's `control-types.ts`, `schedule` in the Schedule plugin's `types.ts`; a consumer that renders the families imports those modules for its cases and keeps a generic line for any other key. A provider answers the waterfall by prepending its `SessionActivity` entries to the result of `next()`; the registry's innermost callback returns an empty list, so a composition without providers archives freely.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One reason a session counts as active for archive admission. Families with
 * per-item identity list their items so a caller can name what must stop.
 */
interface SessionActivity {
  readonly kind: SessionActivityKind
  /** Active items of the family; absent for a family without per-item identity (`turn`). */
  readonly items?: readonly SessionActivityItem[]
}
```

`SessionActivityItem` carries the family-specific `id` (a session, job, or schedule id) and an optional display `label`. `archiveSession(sessionId)` asks the waterfall once, after the existence check, and rejects a non-empty answer with `WorkspaceActiveSessionError` (`sessionId`, `activity`) without writing; the controller maps it to the `workspace/session-active` error, whose details carry the same two fields. `archiveSession(sessionId, { stopActivity: true })` — the `ArchiveSessionOptions` field the transport request exposes as `stopActivity` — skips the check, writes the archive, then dispatches `workspace/session-stop`; a rejecting provider is logged and the archive stays, and the stopped work is never awaited to settlement. An already archived id neither asks nor stops. The shipped providers, what they stop, and the `agent/pre-step` gate that keeps an archived Session from running a model step are documented with the [registry package](../../packages/workspace/workspace/README.md#api-behavior); the decision record is the [archive-stops-running-work Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-09-21-archive-stops-running-session-work.md).

## Consumers

[`dsh-workspace-controller`](../../packages/api/workspace-controller) serves workspace CRUD to GUI clients over `ctx.workspaceRegistry`, and [`dsh-session-controller`](../../packages/api/session-controller) performs the create-session-then-attach flow above. [dsh-agent-instructions](../../packages/context/agent-instructions) is **not** a consumer despite the name: it discovers AGENTS.md-style instruction files under an agent's own cwd and never touches `ctx.workspaceRegistry` — the shared word refers to the user's working directory, not to this registry's entities.

Abstract directory-picking service. Subclass, implement `capability()`, and load the subclass as a plugin — it registers as `ctx.directoryPicker` (one implementation per context; loading a second throws, cordis' standard duplicate-service behavior). The capability object must be stable for the service lifetime: consumers may capture it across calls.

### `ctx.workspaceRegistry` — `WorkspaceRegistry`

Durable workspace registry. Startup waits for `sessionPersistence`, builds one canonical-cwd header index, and completes the one-time history bootstrap before the service becomes active. The persistence dependency is mandatory so an unavailable peer can never be mistaken for an empty history and commit the initialized marker.

#### `workspace/session-activity` — waterfall

Ask the composed providers what still runs for a session before it is archived. A listener prepends its own SessionActivity entries to the result of `next()`; the registry's innermost callback returns an empty list, so a composition without providers archives freely. Any non-empty result refuses the archive without a write.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Ask the composed providers what still runs for a session before it is
 * archived. A listener prepends its own {@link SessionActivity} entries to
 * the result of `next()`; the registry's innermost callback returns an
 * empty list, so a composition without providers archives freely. Any
 * non-empty result refuses the archive without a write.
 * @param request - the session about to be archived.
 * @param next - delegate to the remaining providers.
 * @mode waterfall

<a id="workspacesession-stop--parallel"></a>

#### `workspace/session-stop` — parallel

Stop a session's running work because the caller archived it with `stopActivity`; the archive set is durable when this dispatches. Each provider stops its own families — cancelling a turn, its subagent descendants, owned jobs, or active schedules — through the same cancel paths the user's own stop actions use, so the session log ends every open turn regularly and a later unarchive can continue the conversation. Listeners issue their stop requests without waiting for running work to settle; a listener may await its own durability barrier. A rejection is logged by the registry and does not undo the archive.
