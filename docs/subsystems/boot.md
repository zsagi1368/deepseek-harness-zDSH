# Profile management

English | [中文](boot.zh.md)

The [boot package group](../../packages/boot/README.md) owns launcher-provided profile access and the plugin manager. [Plugin Manager](../../packages/boot/plugin-manager/README.md) documents persistence, reload and package-operation behavior.

## Management records

`PluginEntryId` identifies one Loader entry; callers obtain it from `listPlugins` rather than constructing a patch id.

`PluginInfo` carries module identity, effective enablement, fiber phase and optional display `meta`, plus a unique `patchId` or a `readOnlyReason`.

`BundleInfo` carries the package name, optional installed version, selected enablement, removal availability and optional resolution error. Its optional `meta` and each `BundleRowInfo.meta` contain display text or a metadata diagnostic; Clients select a language at render time.

`InstallBundleOptions.enabled` defaults to true. False installs without selecting the bundle layer. `approvedBuilds` grants persistent script permission to the supplied pending package names before installation. `registry` names the registry asked first; absent, the configured one.

`PluginRegistries` carries the configured first registry, `null` for the one pnpm's own configuration names, the fallbacks asked after it, and `resolved`, the URL pnpm's own configuration names or `null` while unread. `InspectOptions.registry` names the registry a lookup asks first.

`ChangeResult.changed` reports a disk edit independently of `application`: `applied`, `restart-required`, `overridden` or `failed`. Optional `error` carries a localizable code and external diagnostic. `packageResult` records the pnpm exit code, bounded output, truncation flag and complete diagnostic log path, plus `timedOut` when the manager terminated a run that stopped printing. A terminated run is classified `timeout` whatever exit status the signal left behind, so installation and removal report failure instead of success and no further registry is asked. `pendingBuilds` lists undecided packages across the profile; `approvedBuilds` records the names granted permission by this operation; `registries` lists the registries an installation asked, in order; `failedAt` says whether the last failed run could not reach the registry it asked or the host a git or tarball spec is fetched from.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

<a id="ctxconfigeditor--configeditor"></a>

### `ctx.configEditor` — `ConfigEditor`

Persist complete raw configs and apply them through the normal Loader path.

```ts cordis-catalog
/** Addressable profile rows; nested Includes have independent configuration ownership.
 * @returns Active entries with unique profile patch ids.
 */
entries(): Entry[]

/** Read inherited and explicit profile values for the active entries.
 * @returns Detached layer values alongside their Loader entries.
 */
configuration(): Array<{ entry: Entry; inherited: Record<string, unknown>; override: Record<string, unknown> }>

/** Validate, persist, and reconcile a plugin's next config; ordinary fields keep normal lifecycle rules.
 * @param entry Current Loader entry, also used to detect replacement during the write.
 * @param change Derive a raw config from the current entry and its inherited layer.
 * @returns Fulfillment after Loader reconciliation completes.
 */
async edit( entry: Entry, change: (current: Record<string, unknown>, inherited: Record<string, unknown>) => Record<string, unknown>, ): Promise<void>

### `ctx.hmr` — `Hmr`

Hot reload service with Cordis-compatible module configuration and events.

```ts cordis-catalog

/** Read the registries this manager asks: the configured first one, its fallbacks in order, and what pnpm's own configuration names.
