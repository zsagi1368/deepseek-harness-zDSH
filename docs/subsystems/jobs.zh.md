# 后台任务运行时

[English](jobs.md) | 中文

长时间运行的生产方、`ctx.jobs` 与任务控制命令共用的类型。[seam 收敛 Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-03-jobs-seam-consolidation.zh.md) 负责当前设计，[运行时 Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-06-20-generic-long-running-tool-runtime.zh.md) 记录其起源；本页记录 [`packages/jobs/jobs/src/types.ts`](../../packages/jobs/jobs/src/types.ts) 与客户端安全叶子 [`view.ts`](../../packages/jobs/jobs/src/view.ts) 中的确切字段与变体。

## ID 与状态

`JobId` 是按 `<kind>-N` 生成的[品牌化 id](core.zh.md#branded-ids)。访问控制依赖拥有者授权，而非 id 的保密性。`JobKind` 派生自可合并扩展的 map；注册表将各个 kind 视为不透明的 id 命名空间。

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Producer-defined job kinds. Plugins extend this map by declaration merging;
 * the registry treats every value as an opaque id namespace.
 */
interface JobKindMap {
  bash: 'bash'
  subagent: 'subagent'
}
```

`JobStatus` 为 `'running' | 'stopping' | 'completed' | 'killed' | 'failed'`；生产方特有的事实在运行期间归入 `JobView.progress`，结算后归入 `JobView.detail`。

## 生产方约定

`JobSpec` 声明身份、拥有者会话、可选的拉取式 `output` 源与启动器。运行时会在完成预检后携带该 job 的 `JobHandle` 调用 `run()`，随后提交注册，不再执行可能失败的步骤。生产方拥有执行资源；运行时拥有身份、访问、生命周期状态与输出环。

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Producer declaration passed to {@link JobRegistry.start}. The runtime
 * preflights access and cleanup before invoking {@link run}; the producer owns
 * execution resources while the runtime owns identity, lifecycle state, and
 * the output ring.
 */
interface JobSpec {
  /** Producer kind — also the id prefix (`bash`, `subagent`, …). */
  kind: JobKind
  /** One-line model-facing label (the command; the delegation description). */
  label: string
  /**
   * Owning session. Access is fenced by it, and the owner's live Agent must be
   * the one currently registered under that id: its disposal cancels and
   * awaits the job. Omitting the owner creates an unowned job, open to any
   * caller until service disposal.
   */
  owner?: SessionId
  /**
   * Optional UTF-8 byte cap for each complete model-facing completion notice or
   * output read, including controller status metadata. Independent of ring
   * retention: it bounds the consuming model surface, never observers.
   */
  outputLimitBytes?: number
  /**
   * Pull sources the registry pumps into the ring at its own cadence.
   * Producers that narrate their own progress use {@link JobHandle.append}
   * instead; a job may use both.
   */
  output?: readonly JobOutputSource[]
  /**
   * Start the work after preflight and synchronously return its hooks. Called
   * once with the job's producer face; a throw leaves nothing registered (the
   * spent ordinal is skipped), and the producer must clean up any partially
   * started resources.
   * @param job - the issued id plus the ring append and progress writers.
   */
  run(job: JobHandle): JobHooks
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Producer face of one registered job, handed to {@link JobSpec.run} and
 * valid for the job's whole life. All methods are synchronous. Writes staged
 * inside the starter call are retained and become visible with the
 * registration commit; after settlement — the producer's own outcome, a kill,
 * or a registry-forced teardown end — writes log and drop instead of
 * throwing, so a producer's trailing flush cannot break its own teardown path.
 */
interface JobHandle {
  /** The registry-issued id (`<kind>-N`). */
  readonly id: JobId
  /**
   * Append one chunk to the output ring. Offsets advance by the chunk's UTF-8
   * byte length; an empty chunk is dropped without waking observers.
   * @param text - the chunk text, exactly as produced.
   * @param options - stream label and gap marker.
   */
  append(text: string, options?: JobAppendOptions): void
  /**
   * Replace the live progress line (`3/10`, the current phase). Settlement
   * clears it; the terminal reason travels in {@link JobOutcome.detail}.
   * @param line - the new progress line.
   */
  updateProgress(line: string): void
}
```

`JobHooks.done` 会在生产方释放其资源后 resolve，而不是仅在工作完成时 resolve。结果是一个值而非流的 job——subagent 的报告、workflow 渲染出的结果——把它作为 `JobOutcome.result` 返回；模型在结算后的第一次读取携带它一次。

```ts type-equiv
/** Hooks through which the runtime controls and observes producer work. */
interface JobHooks {
  /**
   * Request termination. Must be synchronous, idempotent, and eventually settle
   * {@link done}; throws propagate. The optional reason is forwarded verbatim.
   */
  cancel(reason?: string): void
  /**
   * Resolves after the producer releases its resources, not merely when work
   * finishes. Must not reject; the runtime converts a rejection to `failed`.
   * If teardown cancellation throws, the runtime may force-fail only the
   * registry record without claiming that the work stopped.
   */
  done: Promise<JobOutcome>
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Terminal result supplied by a producer through {@link JobHooks.done}. */
interface JobOutcome {
  /** How the job ended: finished (`completed`), cancelled (`killed`), or broke (`failed`). */
  status: 'completed' | 'killed' | 'failed'
  /**
   * Terminal reason rendered into status lines (`exit code: 3`, `max-tokens`).
   * When the job settles `killed` after a {@link JobRegistry.kill} with a
   * reason, the registry appends that reason.
   */
  detail?: string
  /**
   * Return value for jobs whose result is a value rather than a stream (a
   * workflow's rendered result, a subagent's report). The output ring carries
   * the stream; this is handed out once by the model's next {@link JobRegistry.read}.
   */
  result?: string
}
```

拉取源把一个非消耗的偏移读取器——子进程的 `readFrom` 家族——交给注册表。注册表按自己的节奏（`dsh-jobs-local` 的 `pumpPollMs`）泵送每个源，并在结算封环之前再排干一次，因此生产方不需要把任何东西折进 `done`。

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * A pull source the registry pumps into the job's output ring — the subprocess
 * `readFrom` family. The registry owns the cadence and drains every source one
 * last time before settlement closes the ring, so a producer folds nothing
 * into its `done`.
 */
interface JobOutputSource {
  /** Stream label attached to every chunk this source yields. */
  channel?: JobChannel
  /**
   * Read everything captured since `fromByte` without consuming it.
   * @param fromByte - whole-stream offset to resume from (a prior read's `nextOffset`; 0 first).
   * @returns the delta text, the next offset, the lossy flag, and the spill path the source currently keeps.
   */
  read(fromByte: number): JobSourceRead
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** One incremental read from a {@link JobOutputSource}. */
interface JobSourceRead {
  /** Text captured since the requested offset (the whole retained tail when lossy). */
  text: string
  /** Whole-stream offset to resume from on the next read. */
  nextOffset: number
  /** True when the requested offset slid out of the source's retained window. */
  lossy: boolean
  /**
   * Host path of a file holding the complete stream, when the source
   * currently keeps an intact one. Reported on every read, so the registry
   * tracks it as source metadata: a later read without it withdraws the file.
   */
  spillPath?: string
}
```

## 输出环

每个 job 拥有一个有界的环。拉取源被泵入其中，`JobHandle.append` 的推送整块落地；模型通过注册表保管的游标（`JobRegistry.read`）消耗该环，任意数量的观察者按绝对字节偏移读取它（`JobRegistry.readAt`），二者互不干扰。`JobChannel` 标记 `stdout`、`stderr` 与 `log`；`log` 是只到达观察者、从不进入模型消耗式读取的生产方叙述。结算即封流并把保留量裁剪到结算上限——环没有独立的生命周期。拉取源保留的 spill 文件是 job 元数据（`JobView.output.spillPaths`，每次泵读取都会刷新），不是逐块元数据，所以环淘汰了字节之后、甚至缺口 chunk 本身也被淘汰之后，模型的丢失输出提示仍能点名该文件。浏览器通过 [`dsh-api-job-controller`](../../packages/api/job-controller/README.zh.md) 的 Remote 流 `job.list` 与 `job.follow` 触达名册与环，其帧列于下文的 Cordis API 一节。

```ts type-equiv
/** One chunk of a job's output ring: absolute offset, text, channel, and loss marker. */
interface JobChunk {
  /** Absolute offset of the chunk's first byte; offsets never move once assigned. */
  readonly at: number
  /** Chunk text exactly as appended (possibly tail-trimmed by retention). */
  readonly text: string
  /** Stream label, when the producer supplied one. */
  readonly channel?: JobChannel
  /** Bytes immediately before this chunk were lost, at the producer or to retention. */
  readonly gapBefore?: true
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Result of one non-consuming {@link JobRegistry.readAt}. */
interface JobOutputRead {
  /** Retained chunks overlapping `[from, total)`, in offset order. */
  chunks: readonly JobChunk[]
  /**
   * Offset to resume from — the ring's current `total`. Always a chunk
   * boundary: appends land whole and trimming only advances chunk starts, and
   * consumers concatenate `chunks` under that assumption, so a provider
   * serving partial chunks would silently duplicate text.
   */
  next: number
  /** True when `from` fell below the oldest retained byte, so bytes are missing before `chunks`. */
  lossy: boolean
}
```

## 消费方视图

`JobView` 是每个读者都消费的唯一投影：模型工具、浏览器名册与观测流。`owner` 携带划定访问边界的会话 id；注册表为生命周期清理解析其背后的活体 `Agent`，从不把该对象交出去。`progress` 是生产方的实时行，结算时清除；`detail` 是终态原因，合并了记录下来的 kill 原因。

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Read-only projection of one job — a fresh object per call, never live
 * registry state. The model tools, the browser roster, and the observation
 * stream all consume this one shape.
 */
interface JobView {
  /** The registry-issued id (`<kind>-N`). */
  readonly id: JobId
  /**
   * The producer kind the job was registered with: a Host-registered
   * `JobKind`, carried as an open string because a browser bundle or a Remote
   * codec sees only the `JobKindMap` merges its own program compiles.
   */
  readonly kind: string
  /** The producer-supplied one-line label. */
  readonly label: string
  /** Owning session; absent for an unowned job, which every caller can see. */
  readonly owner?: SessionId
  /** Producer-owned cap for complete model-facing notices and reads, in UTF-8 bytes. */
  readonly outputLimitBytes?: number
  /** Current lifecycle state. */
  readonly status: JobStatus
  /** The producer's live progress line (`3/10`, the current phase); cleared at settlement. */
  readonly progress?: string
  /** Terminal reason (`exit code: 3`); a recorded kill reason is merged in. */
  readonly detail?: string
  /** Epoch ms when the job was registered. */
  readonly startedAt: number
  /** Epoch ms when the job settled; absent while live. */
  readonly finishedAt?: number
  /**
   * The output ring's absolute coordinates and the complete-stream files
   * behind it. `total` is the offset the next chunk starts at (0 while
   * nothing was written); `earliest` is the oldest retained byte, greater
   * than zero exactly when retention dropped the head. `spillPaths` lists the
   * spill files the job's pull sources currently keep, in source order and
   * deduplicated, and is absent while no source keeps one: it outlives any
   * chunk, so a reader below `earliest` can still name where the bytes went.
   */
  readonly output: { readonly total: number; readonly earliest: number; readonly spillPaths?: readonly string[] }
}
```

`JobRegistry` 的 `list`、`get`、`read`、`readAt`、`kill` 和 `wait` 各自接收调用方的 `SessionId`；省略调用方时仅可访问无主 job，传入会话时还可访问该会话拥有的 job。

```ts type-equiv
/** Output and post-read state returned by the consuming {@link JobRegistry.read}. */
interface JobRead {
  /** Ring chunks appended since the model cursor, in offset order; every channel included. */
  chunks: readonly JobChunk[]
  /** True when the cursor fell below the oldest retained byte, so bytes are missing before `chunks`. */
  lossy: boolean
  /** The producer's {@link JobOutcome.result}, handed out by the first read after settlement only. */
  result?: string
  /** The job's state at read time. */
  job: JobView
}
```

## 事件

注册表通过一条带过滤的流宣布每次提交。生命周期事件携带其所宣布的提交之后的投影；`settled` 标出原因，完成播报方据此跳过 teardown；`output` 只携带 id 与新的 total，观察者从自己的游标读取，注册表从不推送负载。

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One lifecycle or output event. Lifecycle events carry the job's projection
 * after the commit they announce; `output` carries only the id and the new
 * total, so an observer schedules a {@link JobRegistry.readAt} from its own
 * cursor and the registry never pushes payloads.
 */
type JobEvent =
  | {
    /** Registration commit, progress line change, stopping transition, or removal from the visible set. */
    readonly type: 'registered' | 'progress' | 'stopping' | 'removed'
    readonly job: JobView
  }
  | {
    readonly type: 'settled'
    readonly job: JobView
    readonly cause: JobSettleCause
    /**
     * Whether this settlement released a live {@link JobRegistry.wait}. That
     * waiter's caller receives the terminal projection as its own result, so
     * a completion reporter treats an awaited settlement as already delivered
     * and reports only the unawaited ones. A wait that timed out or was
     * aborted before the settlement does not count.
     */
    readonly awaited: boolean
  }
  | {
    readonly type: 'output'
    readonly id: JobId
    /** Owning session, absent for an unowned job. */
    readonly owner?: SessionId
    /** The ring's total after the append (or at settlement, which ends the stream). */
    readonly total: number
  }
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Who a subscription hears about. `{ owner }` delivers that session's jobs
 * plus every unowned job (the set that session can see). `{ owners: 'scope' }`
 * delivers the owners composed under the subscribing context — one registry
 * serves every composition in the process, and a mount under one preset must
 * not hear another preset's agents. `{ owners: 'all' }` delivers everything.
 */
type JobEventFilter =
  | { readonly owner: SessionId }
  | { readonly owners: 'all' | 'scope' }
```

## 服务行为

抽象的 [`JobRegistry`](../../packages/jobs/jobs/src/index.ts) Service Definition 规定了原子化的 `start`、各自接收调用方的 `list`、`get`、消耗式 `read`、非消耗的 `readAt`、`kill` 与有界的 `wait`、带过滤的 `events` 流，以及 `attachController`；[`LocalJobRegistry`](../../packages/jobs/jobs-local/src/index.ts) 是进程本地的 Service Provider。授权比较拥有者会话；拥有者清理与准入使用 job 启动时登记在该拥有者会话下的活体 `Agent`。本地提供方的正安全整数配置 `maxConcurrentJobsPerOwner` 默认为 `10`，按精确拥有者统计 `running` 加 `stopping` 记录，无主任务共享一个桶；生产方的终态结算释放容量；`retainBytes`（默认 262144）与 `settledRetainBytes`（默认 16384）约束每个环的运行期与结算后保留量，`pumpPollMs`（默认 150）是拉取节奏。参见 [`dsh-jobs`](../../packages/jobs/jobs/README.zh.md) 了解 Service Definition 约定，[`dsh-jobs-local`](../../packages/jobs/jobs-local/README.zh.md) 了解注册表生命周期与准入策略，[`dsh-tool-jobs`](../../packages/jobs/tool-jobs/README.zh.md) 了解面向模型的 Consumer。

<a id="ctxjobs--jobregistry-abstract-seam"></a>

### `ctx.jobs` — `JobRegistry` (abstract seam)

Abstract background job registry. Subclass, implement the abstract members, and load the subclass as a plugin — it registers as `ctx.jobs` (one implementation per context; loading a second throws, which is cordis' standard duplicate-service behavior).

Implementations must honor these semantics:

- Registrations outlive producer and controller fibers. Owner and service disposal cancel live work and await compliant producers; a throwing teardown cancel force-fails only the record. Such settlements announce `cause: 'teardown'`, because a job whose owner is being destroyed has no reader left.
- Owned-job access is fenced by the owner's session id. Ids are predictable, so authorization — not secrecy — is the boundary.
- Settlement is first-wins: one terminal record, released waiters, then one round of contained event delivery, even against a late producer outcome. The `settled` event follows every released waiter and reports whether it released one (`awaited`), so a completion reporter can skip settlements a waiting caller already collected.
- A settled record stays listed until its owner's disposal, service disposal, or an explicit remove by a caller that collected the terminal state itself and never handed the id out.
- start refuses work while no attached job controller serves the spec's owner, so a producer cannot start work that owner cannot collect or stop. One registry serves every composition in the process, so this question — and event delivery under `{ owners: 'scope' }` — is owner-relative rather than process-wide: registrations made from an unscoped context serve every owner, and registrations made under an agent composition's scope serve exactly the agents composed under it.
- Every job owns one output ring. Pull sources named by the spec are pumped by the registry and drained once more before settlement; pushed appends land whole. The model's consuming cursor and observers' absolute offsets read the same bytes and never disturb each other.
- Ring retention is bounded. Appends past the live cap drop the oldest retained bytes; a reader below the retained window gets a lossy read, never an error. Settlement trims retention to the settled cap and ends the stream; the ring has no separate lifecycle.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Preflight access, validation, owner cleanup, and implementation-owned
 * admission before starting and atomically registering work. Any preflight
 * rejection leaves no job id or execution resource. A throwing starter
 * leaves nothing registered; after it returns, registration cannot fail.
