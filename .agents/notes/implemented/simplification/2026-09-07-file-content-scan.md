# Agent Note: Scan file content without per-array callbacks

Status: implemented

English | [中文](2026-09-07-file-content-scan.zh.md)

## Problem

Every model dispatch checks complete message content for files, including nested tool results. A request-history CPU profile attributes 23.540 ms of self time to `contentHasFile` and 5.584 ms to its callback. This traversal remains necessary even after [loop-owned freeze provenance](2026-09-06-agent-request-freeze-provenance.md) removes repeated request freezing. The hot LLM source is identical at master `bd5917`, master `112a5`, and the measured `f834b002826453e7918eeb558d052b2c24c56a76`; these observations do not establish PR causality.

## Decision

[`contentHasFile`](../../../../packages/llm/llm/src/content.ts) uses direct iteration instead of recursive `Array.some` callbacks. It preserves early exit, nested tool-result traversal, and false results for other block kinds. It stores no identities, validation results, or freeze proofs. Image detection, file projection, and request construction keep their existing behavior. The [request-freeze calibration](2026-09-06-agent-request-freeze-provenance.md) owns the request-history budget.

## Measurement evidence

Apple M4 Pro, Node 24.19.0: nine alternating original/candidate pairs run the unchanged [request-history worker](../../../../benchmarks/agent-continuation/agent-continuation.worker.ts) in fresh plain-Node processes. Each process receives a copy of one native-V3 seed. Only the built LLM entry changes; every sample completes 40 requests, zero live tools, and 13,925 events. All totals below are milliseconds, in pair order.

| Variant | Raw totals | Median |
|---|---|---:|
| Original | 61.772167, 66.480917, 63.590042, 62.250333, 63.804875, 62.504208, 61.887958, 61.062959, 67.120125 | 62.504208 |
| Direct iteration | 53.655375, 56.223416, 57.078125, 54.559250, 54.271459, 55.288917, 55.400416, 56.191916, 54.877041 | 55.288917 |

The median improves 11.54%; all nine pairs improve, by 4.871–12.243 ms. User CPU medians are 82.019/76.150 ms. A separate five-pair scan probe uses the same synthetic history: 5,601 frozen messages, 13,600 blocks, and 8,801 content arrays scanned 40 times. Original totals are 17.188584, 17.944000, 16.869458, 17.437750, 17.459708; direct iteration totals are 8.726333, 8.373000, 8.851750, 8.479167, 9.074083. These local measurements establish an implementation gain, not a hosted-CI pass or a new calibration.

## Alternatives considered

A weak negative-result cache needs proof that every relevant descendant is immutable; a shallow-frozen root is insufficient. Direct iteration provides measured savings without introducing that ownership or invalidation problem. Optimizing image traversal or system-prompt projection lacks evidence from this experiment and is outside this change.

## Consequences

The scan remains linear in visited blocks and rereads mutable nested content on each call. [Content tests](../../../../packages/llm/llm/tests/content.spec.ts) cover empty, frozen, nested, and subsequently mutated arrays; service tests preserve file-handle projection, and request-freeze, reconstruction, and resume tests preserve native-history semantics. No model-visible text or Session format changes. The freeze-provenance and [backend-baseline](../testing/2026-09-06-backend-continuation-performance.md) notes retain independent ownership; neither is superseded.
