# Agent Note: Follow package-local forwarding modules in Typert references

Status: implemented

## Problem

`WorkspaceAnalyzer` resolves every type reference to its original declaration before classifying it, then reads only the referencing file's own `import` statement to decide whether the reference crossed a package through a public export. A package that re-exports another package's type from one of its own modules, and imports that module by relative path elsewhere, therefore fails with `crosses a package without an explicit package import` although the package import exists one hop away. The failure is deterministic for every batch size and package order; it surfaces in whichever analysis selects the referencing package as a root, which is why [issue 3525](https://github.com/deepseek-harness/deepseek-harness/issues/3525) observed it as batch-dependent.

## Decision

[`targetForReference`](../../../../packages/typert/generator/src/analyzer.ts) resolves a relative specifier through the face's shared compiler host and module-resolution cache and follows it only while the resolved file stays inside the referencing package. In each forwarding module it collects the `export` edges that carry the requested name: a named re-export with a specifier, an `export { local }` backed by that module's `import`, and star re-exports whose module exports the same symbol. Explicit edges are tried before star edges, matching TypeScript's shadowing of star exports, and each resolved module and requested export-name pair is entered once, so circular star re-exports terminate while distinct renamed routes through one module remain available. The walk stops at the first package specifier and feeds that identity and export name to the existing `packageExportName` check, so a forwarded type must still be public at the package subpath the forwarding module names, and a package name without a registration is refused there. The reference model is unchanged: the target remains `declaration` for a same-face owner and `cross-face` for another face.

The walk yields no package import, and the reference fails as before, when a relative specifier resolves outside the referencing package, when the only edge carrying the name is a namespace re-export or a re-exported namespace import, or when every edge loops back to a module and requested-name pair already entered.

## Alternatives considered

**Treat a relative import whose alias chain ends in another package as implicitly public.** Rejected: it would accept `../../other/src/file.ts` and any forwarding module that itself reaches the other package by relative path, removing the public-export check the generated Remote declarations rely on to name an importable subpath.

**Record the forwarding module as the reference target.** Rejected: emitters and cross-face links need the original declaration's package and public subpath; a package-local module has no public identity of its own.

**Select edges in source order without symbol checks.** Rejected: a star re-export that loops back to an earlier module can precede the explicit re-export that actually carries the type, and TypeScript itself lets explicit exports shadow star exports; ordering explicit edges first and continuing past an entered module and requested-name pair keeps such modules accepted without an unbounded walk.

**Make batched and whole-workspace analysis select the same roots.** Rejected as a fix: root selection does not change the verdict on a reference, only whether the reference is visited, so aligning the callers would hide the incorrect classification rather than remove it.

## Consequences

Packages may keep one forwarding module for foreign types and import it relatively, matching how their own modules are organized. Each cross-package relative reference costs one module resolution per hop through the face's shared resolution cache; `reachableFiles` now resolves through the same cache. [`type-model.spec.ts`](../../../../packages/typert/generator/tests/type-model.spec.ts) pins named, renamed multi-hop, import-then-export, star, and namespace-import forwarding, an explicit re-export beside a looping star edge, distinct renamed routes through one shared module, a forwarded private export, a forwarding module that crosses by relative path, a cycle whose only exit crosses by relative path, a namespace re-export, a re-exported namespace import, cross-face forwarding, and equality of whole and batched analysis for the forwarding fixture across batch sizes and package orders.
