# web/ — web access capability family

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `web/` packages let models search the public web and fetch HTTP(S) pages through the `web_search` and `web_fetch` tools. Deployments can choose Exa, Perplexity, or DeepSeek for search and anonymous HTTP(S) access for fetch; availability and resource limits depend on the configured provider. Use this family for search and page retrieval, not interactive browsing, content extraction, or per-URL policy enforcement. Models receive consistent tool behavior, cancellation, and error reporting when providers change.

## Packages

Six packages play the web roles; the subsystem reference owns the exhaustive vocabulary and contracts.

| Package | Role | ctx key |
|---|---|---|
| [`web/`](web/README.md) | Search/fetch service: search and fetch URLs through interchangeable backends, one selection and error policy | `ctx.web` |
| [`web-search-exa/`](web-search-exa/README.md) | Searches the web through Exa | registers on `ctx.web` |
| [`web-search-perplexity/`](web-search-perplexity/README.md) | Searches the web through Perplexity | registers on `ctx.web` |
| [`web-search-deepseek/`](web-search-deepseek/README.md) | Searches the web through DeepSeek native search | registers on `ctx.web` |
| [`web-fetch-http/`](web-fetch-http/README.md) | Fetches public HTTP(S) pages anonymously | registers on `ctx.web` |
| [`tool-web/`](tool-web/README.md) | Exposes `web_search` and `web_fetch` to the model | registers on `ctx.tools` |

Start with the subsystem reference for the shared vocabulary, then the design decision behind the single provider-selection service.
