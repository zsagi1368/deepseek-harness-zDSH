# Bundles and Host plugins

A bundle is a package whose `package.json` declares `dsh.bundle.patch`; the YAML patch inserts plugin entries. Give the package and rows unique names; use the Loader's existing YAML syntax, including `!!js` where expressions are needed. Read an existing patch before editing it: a matching override replaces the complete `config`.

## Manifest

A Host-only bundle needs no dependencies, install scripts, or build tool:

```json
{
  "name": "@local/my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "exports": { ".": "./index.js" },
  "dsh": { "bundle": { "patch": "./cordis.patch.yml" } }
}
```

`cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: my-plugin
      name: '@local/my-plugin'
      config: {}
```

## Display metadata and icon

Plugin Manager cards, bundle details, component rows, and the Settings plugin inventory read display text and an icon from the manifest without activating the plugin. Put the title and description in `locale/en.json` (other languages such as `locale/zh.json` use the same fields), and declare the icon as a top-level `icon` in `package.json`:

```json
{ "meta": { "title": "My Decoration", "description": "Draws a badge under the composer." } }
```

```json
{
  "icon": "./icon.svg",
  "exports": { "./package.json": "./package.json", "./locale/*.json": "./locale/*.json" },
  "files": ["locale/*.json", "icon.svg"]
}
```

`icon` is a path relative to the manifest directory; SVG, PNG, JPEG, and WebP up to 256 KiB are accepted, while absolute paths, URLs, paths outside the directory, and symlinks leaving it are rejected. Missing fields fall back to `package.json` `name` and `description` and to the panel's default artwork; malformed metadata produces a diagnostic and keeps the valid text.

## Host plugin export forms

`index.js` exports one of these forms; do not mix them:

- `export function apply(ctx, config) {}` with optional `export const inject = ['tools']` and `export const Config`.
- A service class as the default export.

Register every resource inside `apply` with `ctx.effect` or `ctx.on` and return its cleanup. A plugin that declares `Config` validates the row's `config` at activation; query `Config.listConfigs` for an installed plugin's schema before writing its `config`, and follow `$defs` references in the returned document.

## Install, enable, and observe

`plugin_manager` `install_bundle` performs package installation and bundle selection; do not reproduce those steps with shell commands. Only pass `approvedBuilds` after the user explicitly approves the reported pending build scripts. Preserve returned failures and pending states; report success only after observing the requested capability.

`list_plugins` and `list_bundles` return exact identifiers for existing installations. `set_plugin` and `set_bundle` toggle them; `remove_bundle` removes a bundle. Inspect saved-state and activation outcomes separately: `failed` requires diagnosis, `overridden` means a higher-priority layer wins, and `restart-required` means the change is not live. Installing a new bundle can activate through HMR; replacing an installed package requires restart to load a fresh JavaScript module generation. Do not infer updated browser code from an unchanged slot id.
