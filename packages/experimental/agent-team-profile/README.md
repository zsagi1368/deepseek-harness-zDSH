# @deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-agent-team-profile

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`dsh-experimental-agent-team-profile` is a published experimental profile layer that enables [Agent Teams](../agent-team/README.md) over `@deepseek-ai/dsh-base`. Its patch inserts the Team domain and Team-scoped tools, disables the overlapping global continuable-child controls, and keeps the ordinary fresh and fork delegation tools as one-shot operations. Add it explicitly to an initialized profile; no shipped profile enables it by default.

## Use this package

### Install into a profile

Add the package to an initialized profile, then run a task that asks the Lead to delegate work:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile headless add @deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-agent-team-profile
dsh --profile headless "Use Agent Teams to split this task between two teammates, wait, and summarize."
```

The profile must already contain `@deepseek-ai/dsh-base`, whose Subagent services and provider rows this layer consumes. Removing the package with `dsh plugin --profile <name> remove @deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-agent-team-profile` removes the bundle from the profile's ordered layer list.

### What you get

The layer adds the Agent Teams domain and its scoped creation, roster, messaging, interruption, waiting, and task-board tools. It disables the global continuable-child control rows whose tool names overlap with Team controls, while leaving `subagent` and `subagent_fork` available as one-shot delegation tools.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The package's runtime content is [`cordis.patch.yml`](cordis.patch.yml). Applied after `dsh-base`, the patch disables `tool-subagent-control` and `tool-subagent-list-agents`; sets the fresh and fork Subagent rows to `one-shot`; and inserts the Team service and tool rows with explicit providers and limits.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`cordis.patch.yml`](cordis.patch.yml) | Ordered patch over `dsh-base` |
| [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) | Empty module entry; the patch is the runtime content |
| — | No runtime invariant companion is published; the package carries only a static profile patch. The Team domain and tool packages own the mutable relationships it activates. |

## Model Experience

### Team policy and tools

#### What the model sees

The Team policy and schemas belong to [`@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-tool-agent-team`](../tool-agent-team/README.md). This bundle changes composition only: Team-scoped `list_agents`, `send_message`, and `interrupt_agent` replace the disabled global continuable-child controls. `subagent` and `subagent_fork` remain available as one-shot delegation tools, whose children do not receive the continuable-child `report` tool.

#### Token effect

The bundle adds the Team policy and tool schemas described by `@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-tool-agent-team`; it adds no prompt text of its own.

#### KV Cache effect

The bundle's composition is prefix-stable while its patch, Team identity, and configured tool schemas remain unchanged.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **Opt-in only** — the package is public, but no shipped CLI, Web, SDK, ACP, or Python profile enables it.
- **Shared checkout** — every teammate observes the same working directory; this bundle adds no worktree isolation or filesystem locking.
- **Base profile required** — the patch depends on row ids and Subagent providers supplied by `dsh-base`; it is not a standalone profile.
