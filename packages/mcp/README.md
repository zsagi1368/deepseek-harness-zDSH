# MCP — Model Context Protocol

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `mcp/` group lets the model call external Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools and read server resources. Configure only `mcp-client` entries; shipped profiles already mount `mcp-resources` once. MCP tools and prompt text appear only for callers with a configured server in scope. Connections also supply server instructions. Package READMEs own configuration and limitations.

## Packages

The client owns each configured connection; the shared resource package supplies resource tools across those connections.

| Package | What it provides |
|---|---|
| [`mcp-client/`](mcp-client/README.md) | Connect one MCP server, expose its tools and instructions, and provide its resource operations |
| [`mcp-resources/`](mcp-resources/README.md) | Discover and read resources through shared tools with explicit server selection |
