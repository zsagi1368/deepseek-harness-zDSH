## Summary

Use this package to expose Session catalog, retain information, and unified UI status through standard Slot hooks. It materializes per-`SessionBinding` hooks and props, while `SessionProvider` can inherit an outer binding or bind an explicit `SessionReference`. It owns process-local pending-interaction and completion-reminder policy without owning Controller transport, history, or references.

Running status comes from Host list baselines or status events. Subagent catalog rows and retained subagent fallback rows do not establish running status; main view references still acknowledge completions.

## Model Experience

None, as this package adapts browser-side Session state and registers nothing model-facing.

#### KV Cache effect

None; Session selectors and Slot scopes do not assemble model requests.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **Pending interactions are process-local projections** — the owning Remote waterfall must replay an outstanding request after a browser reconnect.

None.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. The adapter materialization path enforces Session binding consistency.
