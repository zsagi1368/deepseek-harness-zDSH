/**
 * Stage one of tab-type registration: what a type IS.
 *
 * A registration is purely static — which addresses the type recognizes, how it
 * ranks against other types that recognize the same one, what the tab chip says,
 * and whether the type offers an entry box on the guide page. Nothing here is
 * per-tab, per-session, or a runtime hook: stage two is the keyed
 * `sidebar.right.pane.tab` registration that supplies the body under the same
 * `kind`, and everything a body needs at runtime arrives in its props.
 *
 * Address recognition follows VS Code's editor resolver: a glob declaration
 * narrows the candidates, an optional `canOpen` predicate vetoes, and the
 * survivors are ranked by priority band, then by matched-pattern length, then by
 * registration order. Addresses are `scheme://` URIs; the one local change to
 * VS Code's glob rule is that a pattern containing `:` matches the whole address
 * (`dsh-resource://file/**`, `sidebar://guide`) rather than the URI's path.
 *
 * A kind may carry one `builtin` and one `extension` registration at once: the
 * extension is the one in force — claims, `get`, the guide page, and the body
 * and title, which the seat finds under the definition's own `id` — and the
 * builtin resumes when the extension unregisters. Everything else colliding on
 * a kind throws, as does a second registration of an `id`.
 *
 * Thunked copy (`title`, `guide[].title`, `guide[].description`) is read again
 * on every use, so a language change needs no re-registration.
