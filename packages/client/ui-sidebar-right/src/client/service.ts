/**
 * `ctx.sidebarRight`: what other plugins may ask of this column.
 *
 * The surface is per session and its state lives in that session's store
 * instance, which the slot runtime mints per session and a root service cannot
 * reach on its own. Two paths lead in. The mounted seat publishes its binding —
 * session id, bound actions, its surface — for exactly as long as it is mounted,
 * and every command on the public face goes through that binding; a command
 * arriving with no seat mounted has no session to act on and fails loudly rather
 * than writing into a surface nobody is drawing. And the plugin adopts each
 * session's store instance as the runtime mints it, so the controller reaches
 * any session's store by id and syncs the Tab domain from that store's commits.
 *
 * A tab's own actions (`tabActions`) aim at the session the tab is in, not at
 * the mounted one: they run through that session's adopted store, so a callback
 * fired after the user switched sessions still lands where its tab is, and they
 * do nothing for a session whose store was never minted.
 *
 * `openResource` and `openTab` are the navigation controller, and every way
 * into the column is a call to one of them: the conversation's file links, a
 * tool row's line reference, the strip's add control, a guide entry box, a file
 * tree's rows. A resource is claimed through the registry by address; a page is
 * named by kind and recorded at the address this package composes for it. Both
 * hand the store one settled intent and record the navigation in the Tab
 * domain. Placement is the caller's option, never a type's property.
 *
 * The registration adopts Session stores and injects the mounted seat binding;
 * callers use the service's navigation methods.
