## Summary

The right Sidebar: where the docking kit meets this product. It holds one docking surface per session, draws it as one edge-anchored panel in the frame's right column in either of two presentations, puts the expand button in the conversation header, and owns the navigation controller (`ctx.sidebarRight`), the tab-type registry (`ctx.sidebarRightTabs`), and the Tab domain that tells each open tab how it was navigated to and how long it lives.

## What lives here, and what does not

The layout itself — the split tree, its operations, the drag gestures, the floating panels — belongs to `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-dockkit` and stays host-agnostic. This package supplies everything that kit refuses to know: the product's copy, what a tab's `kind` means, which tab a fresh pane is seeded with, where the surface is mounted, and how other plugins reach it.

<a id="presentations"></a>
## Presentations

Normal and fullscreen presentations share the same content tree, so switching does not remount tabs. The normal panel anchors to the right column; fullscreen covers the viewport while retaining the wide-screen columns underneath. Opening below 768px uses fullscreen automatically; leaving fullscreen on a narrow viewport closes the panel, and widening does not reopen a closed panel. A fullscreen opening keeps the underlying columns unchanged until its slide finishes, then prepares the normal track without a column transition. Before a fullscreen panel retreats, closing prepares a full-width conversation and restoring prepares the normal right track; the background does not animate during the retreat.

| Mode | The track | The panel |
|---|---|---|
| `push` (default) | Panel width: the conversation makes room | In the track; its left edge and the conversation's right edge travel together, on the frame's own curve |
| `fullscreen` | Retains the wide-screen normal track; automatic narrow-screen fullscreen takes no track | Covers the entire viewport |

The seat reports presentation through `ctx.layout.openRightbar(track, fullscreen)` / `closeRightbar()`; the frame does not inject this package. Switching fullscreen on a wide viewport leaves the center width unchanged, and the width handle appears only in expanded normal mode. Independent floating panels and `float`/`dock` operations remain available.

The panel has no header row. Its two controls — the presentation switch and the collapse button — ride the kit's chrome seat at the far end of the top-right pane's tab strip, so the strip is the panel's whole top edge. Each strip reads, left to right: the tab capsules with close controls where allowed, the add control (drawn only while that pane holds no guide tab; it opens the guide there through `ctx.sidebarRight.openTab`), the pane's split control, and in the top-right pane the two panel controls. Only the chips give way in a narrow pane; the controls after them never shrink or clip.

<a id="the-expand-button"></a>
## The expand button

While the panel is hidden, one button in the conversation header's corner seat (`conversation.session.header.corner`, past the utilities' right edge and level with the Session log control) is the way back in. Its glyph is the left sidebar's collapse icon mirrored. It shares the panel's store (the slot runtime allows one handle across two same-scope seats); while the panel is shown it renders nothing, and the corner seat collapses with it. A collapsed Sidebar therefore costs the conversation nothing: no rail, no width, and the transcript's scrollbar stays at the column's edge. Without a session there is no button and no panel.

The panel takes the conversation's ground colour and content font sizes rather than a raised layer of its own: it is a column of the page, not a card over it.

The `rightbar` entry is a root-scoped controller. It reads `usePanelInfo` and mounts the Session-scoped `rightbar.session` subtree only while the Conversation is selected. Switching to a global panel hides the right Sidebar and releases its frame track without deleting the Session's tab state.

<a id="state"></a>
## State

One `SurfaceState` per session id — the layout, its recorded sequence, and how many ids it has minted — held in a store declared at the registration. Every action follows the same shape: mint the ids the intent needs, ask a kit planner which operations carry it out, record them, then assign the session's whole surface back. No action edits a layout in place, which is what keeps the kit's pure functions the only thing that computes one.

Carrying the mint counter in the surface is what makes a recorded sequence replayable: operations embed the ids they create, so replaying from the same initial state reproduces the same tree. Every action records one history entry, however many operations it needed. Expanding, collapsing, and switching presentation are recorded too.

After every action the kit's settle planner keeps the expanded surface populated: a docked pane whose last tab was moved out or floated is merged away, and an emptied root pane receives the default page. A collapsed surface holds no such backfill — a session starts collapsed and empty, and a close that collapses the column leaves it empty — the expansion that would first show an empty layout is what seeds the default page. Explicit closing follows [the default-page and close rules](#the-guide). While expanded there is always at least one tab, and never an empty pane — so there is no separate "close pane" gesture.

The docked surface's last tab carries one more rule, decided in the store's `closeTab` and mirrored to the kit through `canCloseTab`: the guide standing as the only docked tab draws no close control and no menu close item — its chip sits quiet, and with no extension item contributed a secondary press opens no menu — and a programmatic close of it records nothing; any other tab standing alone closes together with the column in one entry — the layout stays empty until the next expansion seeds its current default page. Floating panels take no part in the rule: they render whether or not the column is expanded, and their tabs close freely.

State is memory-only. A reload returns every session to the collapsed default; switching sessions keeps each surface where it was.

<a id="extension-seats"></a>
## Extension seats

A tab type registers in two stages, and the shipped guide type goes through exactly the same public path a type from another package does (`ui-sidebar-documentpreview` is the live proof). Both stages sit inside the type's own `ctx.effect`, so the registration lives exactly as long as the plugin that made it.

1. **The type** — `ctx.sidebarRightTabs.register({ id, kind, patterns?, priority?, canOpen?, title, guide? })`, a static declaration with no runtime hook, returning a disposer. `id` is this implementation's identity in the tab system, unique across every registration (a package name is the natural value; the shipped guide is `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-sidebar-right/guide`): a kind is not unique once an extension may take a builtin's over, so the implementation names itself, and a second registration of an `id` throws. A resource type names `patterns`, globs over `dsh-resource://` addresses: one containing `:` matches the whole address (`dsh-resource://file/**`); one without matches the URI's path at any depth, ignoring case (`*.md`), and an address that is not a URI matches no such pattern. A page type — the guide, a file tree — names none and is opened by kind. `canOpen(address)` vetoes a match. `title(address)` is the tab chip's text, captured when the tab opens. `guide` lists entry boxes for the guide page; picking one opens the contributing type as a page. A `kind` carries at most one `builtin` and one `extension` registration (the extension is in force; the builtin resumes when it leaves); any other collision on a kind throws. The `id` is also the key the type's body and title register under, so an extension and the builtin it takes over hold distinct cells and the seat renders the one in force.
2. **The body** — `ctx.slots.register({ name: 'sidebar.right.pane.tab', key: definition.id }, Body)` reads `{ sidebar, panel, tab }` through the framework-injected `useTabInfo()`. `sidebar` supplies expansion and fullscreen information; `panel.id` identifies its pane; `tab` contains the record fields, `visible`, `navigation`, `signal`, and `actions`. These are not parallel owner props; the type's own store still uses `useStore`/`actions`. Optional title registrations and guide replacements share this hook; an absent title registration uses the text captured at open time.

Which type opens a resource follows the editor-resolver convention: the types whose `patterns` match are ranked by `priority` band — `extension` (a type from outside the product, the highest, and the default when none is named), `builtin`, `fallback` (plain viewers anything more specific should beat) — then by the length of the matched pattern, then by registration order; `canOpen` removes a candidate. The bands are string literals so a type in another package needs no runtime import from here. `candidates(address)` returns the ranking, `claim(address, kind?)` the decision; naming a `kind` skips its globs but keeps its `canOpen`.

Two more seats extend what is already there: `sidebar.right.tab.guide` (chain) replaces the guide tab's body without replacing the tab, and `sidebar.right.tab.menu.item` (list) appends content-level actions to a tab's menu after the kit's own layout actions. No seat exists for pane-level actions or for collapsed-state controls yet, because nothing needs one.

<a id="ctxsidebarright"></a>
## `ctx.sidebarRight`

`openResource(address, options?)` and `openTab(kind, options?)` are the navigation controller, and every way into the column calls one of them: the conversation's file links and a tool row's line reference (`openResource(fileAddress, { params: { line } })`), the strip's add control and a guide entry box (`openTab`), a file tree's rows (`tab.actions.openResource`). A resource address is a `dsh-resource://<type>/…` URI; without `options.kind` the registry claims it (globs and `canOpen`, best band wins), with it that kind's type in force opens it. A page is named by kind; the tab is recorded under an address this package composes and nobody else spells (`contract/seed.ts`). Both run the same steps as one history entry: a resource tab already showing the same (kind, contentId) is focused wherever it sits unless `revealIfOpened: false`; page tabs always deduplicate within the target pane, regardless of that option; otherwise a new tab lands in `options.replaceTab`'s pane and slot (closing that tab), else `options.paneId`, else the active docked pane; the panel expands, because content the user cannot see is not opened. Then the Tab domain records the navigation — `params` reach the body as `navigation.params`, with `revision` stepped — outside the layout history. `params` is typed by what is opened: a viewer for a resource type merges its entry into `SidebarRightResourceParamsMap` (the text preview declares `{ line?: number }`); a page type that takes parameters merges into `SidebarRightTabParamsMap` under its kind; values are JSON-shaped by convention, unchecked at run time. An address outside `dsh-resource://`, one no type claims, or a kind nothing registered throws: that is a wiring mistake, not a user error.

`close(tabId)` closes a tab; `active()` reads the active tab. `isExpanded()` and `toggleExpanded()` read and drive the column's expansion; the presentation switch is the panel's own control and not part of this face. Layout operations, for callers that arrange the column programmatically, each recorded like the gesture it stands in for: `focus(tabId)` focuses a tab and its pane; `split(paneId?)` splits a docked pane (the active one by default) under the same pane budget and room rule as the strip's control and returns the new pane's id, or `undefined` — recording nothing — when it cannot; `float(tabId, rect?)` takes a docked tab out into a panel; `dock(paneId)` returns a floating panel to the active docked pane. A tab or pane that does not exist, or already is where the call would put it, is left alone. The face exposes operations only: no layout snapshot, no operation log, no lookup by address. `_undo()` / `_redo()` step the mounted surface's history; they are `@internal` — the sequence has no user-facing control, and these exist for tests. Commands need a mounted session surface; with none, they throw rather than write into a surface nobody draws.

<a id="the-tab-domain"></a>
## The Tab domain

The Tab domain retains navigation, an abort signal, and bound actions per (Session, tab id). A private assembly callback adopts each Session's store and reconciles records on its commits. Only record removal or plugin unload aborts the signal; closing the sidebar and switching Sessions retain records, while undo restores a new occurrence. `useTabInfo()` composes framework-bound store and navigation hooks without manual component subscriptions or render-time record creation. `tab.actions` always target their own Session; `tab.visible` distinguishes bodies from titles, and floating tabs remain visible when the sidebar closes. `adopt` is absent from the public controller.

<a id="the-guide"></a>
## The guide

Default pages depend on the number of registered guide entries, not the number of tab types or open tabs. Exactly one entry opens its page directly (Files in the shipped composition); zero or multiple entries open the guide. Explicitly adding a guide still opens the guide, even with one entry. The sole docked guide is the only tab that cannot close; closing any other sole tab also collapses the column. The chip, context menu, and `close` API apply the same rule.

The guide tab is a muted compass over one entry capsule per `guide` entry the registered types contributed, in `order`, centred in the body; the guide has no words of its own. A capsule shows the entry's glyph — or the guide's quieter cube placeholder when the entry registered none — and its title; while at most four entries are listed, an entry that registered a `description` shows it under the title, and a longer list drops every description. Picking a capsule calls `tab.actions.openTab(entry.kind, { replaceTab: true })`, so the guide gives way to the page it opened. A pane holds at most one guide tab. The strip's add control is drawn only while its pane holds none and opens one there with `openTab('guide', { paneId, revealIfOpened: false })`, so a guide in another pane does not capture the click; opening the guide into a pane that already has one focuses it instead; a guide dragged, dropped, or docked into such a pane merges into it — the arriving guide closes and the pane's own is focused; `duplicateTab` on the guide records nothing. A split, an expanded empty root pane, and the pane a sole tab vacates by dropping on its own edge use the same default-page rule, one tab per new pane; the self-edge drop leaves the dragged tab focused. A plain `openTab('guide')` opens or focuses the guide only within the active or named pane. Splitting an empty pane does nothing and returns no new pane. The product allows two horizontal panes, initially equal, with divider ratios limited to 20%–80%. Insufficient width blocks a new split; with two panes already present, a body drop moves the tab between panes instead of creating a third. At the two-pane limit, split controls are hidden; closing back to one pane restores them.

<a id="copy"></a>
## Copy

Every string in the column comes from the `sidebarRight` locale namespace, including the kit's accessible names. A tab's title is fixed when the tab is minted; a type's display name follows the current language.

<a id="model-experience"></a>
## Model Experience

None, as the package is a browser-side UI plugin layer that registers nothing model-facing.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **Memory-only.** Nothing is persisted; a reload starts every session collapsed.
- **No surface without a session.** State is keyed by session id, so the hero screen shows nothing on the right.
- **Hard-coded stacking.** The panel and the float host use fixed z-index values because the client has no z-index token layer yet.
- **Undo is not exposed.** The recorded sequence is stepped only through the `@internal` service methods; product controls are deliberately absent.
- **Titles are fixed at open time.** A type's `title(address)` is captured into the record; a live title comes only from the optional title seat.
- **No content navigation stack.** Stepping back replays layout operations; an editor-style back/forward over visited content is not built.

### Dev Note

<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

None.

</details>

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. The two services (`sidebarRight`, `sidebarRightTabs`) are provided through `ctx.reflect.provide` inside one effect and torn down with it; the seat's binding and the Tab domain's occurrence lifetimes are asserted directly by this package's specs, and no independent observation exists to diverge from them.
