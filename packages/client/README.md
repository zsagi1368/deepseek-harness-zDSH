# client/ — web-GUI browser half

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `client/` group provides the browser experience for the dsh web GUI, including conversation, navigation, settings, approvals, file access, and other interactive features. Choose packages from this family when adding browser-visible behavior; use [`host/`](../host/README.md) for server-side page delivery and host integration. Packages cover both the shared browser foundation and focused UI features, while each child README owns its configuration and behavior. Authoring rules live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), and the related documentation below explains cross-package composition.
