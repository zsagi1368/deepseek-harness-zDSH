## Summary

Preview readable files in the right Sidebar and choose among registered renderers without opening another tab. Markdown and code receive accumulated text pages; PDF, HTML, and common images receive complete bytes; unknown file extensions use plain text. The tab owns loading, file status, renderer selection, wrap, and reload, while document bodies register through the same metadata registry and child slot. The Sidebar tab kind is `text`.

## What it registers

- **The type** — `ctx.sidebarRightTabs.register(...)` with id `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-sidebar-documentpreview` (this implementation's identity in the tab system, and the key its body registers under), kind `text`, pattern `dsh-resource://file/**`, band `fallback`. `canOpen` accepts only Session addresses, whose paths may be relative or absolute; bare `absolute` addresses are not claimed. A type registered at the `extension` or `builtin` band for a narrower pattern (say `*.png`) takes those addresses; other supported files land here. The whole address is the content identity, so two files with one name in different directories, or one path under two sessions, are two tabs; the decoded basename is the tab title, and the keyed `sidebar.right.pane.tab.title` seat places its extension-specific `FileTypeIcon` before that title.
- **The body** — the keyed `sidebar.right.pane.tab` seat under the type's id. Its fixed header shows the Host's absolute path when available, otherwise the requested path; directories use tertiary label colour, the name uses primary label colour, and a clipped path retains and fades toward its final segment while its tooltip exposes the full value. A dropdown selects among matching renderers and plain text. A wrap toggle appears only when the selected renderer declares `wrap: true`; its glyph describes the mode the click selects, and the per-tab preference starts on. Reload stays in this header, not the Sidebar's tab strip. The body reaches every pane edge; each renderer owns its content inset and may own an inner scrollport. This intentionally differs from the Files tab's 2px right-side scrollbar offset: previews keep the full pane width so edge-to-edge HTML and code scrollports end at the pane edge.
- **Shared loading and view state**, session-scoped and bucketed by tab id. The store holds accumulated pages or complete bytes, read and observed versions, loading/failure state, renderer choice, scroll offset, wrap, and the answered navigation revision. The ordinary inject face calls Remote readers and writes through declared store actions. Reloads and loading-mode changes retire older requests; the tab's abort signal forgets its state.

Document implementations register metadata with `ctx.documentPreviews.register({ id, extensions, priority, title, loading, wrap? })` and a body under the same `id` in the keyed, Session-scoped `sidebar.right.tab.document` child slot. Own both registrations with effects and wait for the child slot through `ctx.slots.inject`. Bodies receive `resourceAddress`, prepared `content`, `wrap`, `scrollportRef`, and the standard `useTabInfo`/`useResource` hooks; they do not receive a custom resource loader. A renderer that owns an inner scrolling element attaches `scrollportRef` to it, and the owner returns to the shared body when that element unmounts. Metadata declares `loading: 'text-pages'` or `'bytes-complete'`. The registry retains all matching alternatives: `extension` (the default) ranks above `builtin`, then longer suffixes rank first, then registration order. The dropdown preserves a selected implementation while it remains available; removing it selects the next candidate. Builtin bodies use these same registrations.

<a id="addresses"></a>
## Addresses

A tab uses the Session address built by `fileAddressFor`, carrying a relative or absolute path. `hostFileOf(address)` takes the Session only from that address, with no external Session argument; neither current nor Tab Session is borrowed. The Host resolves file and related paths through the Session filesystem, whose backend controls read authority. Metadata for the same complete address is shared by every UI, including Global components. The [Workspace Files README](../../api/workspace-files/README.md) owns these rules; renderer selection does not change the navigation address.

<a id="how-it-reads"></a>
## How it reads

The body reads its record, navigation and lifetime through `useTabInfo().tab`. `useResource<'file'>(tab.contentId)` supplies metadata; ordinary inject callbacks supply content reads:

- The resource snapshot contains only `status`, `value`, and `failure`; `value` is `WorkspaceFileStat` metadata. Content reads do not wait for the first metadata frame once the provider is available. Observation failures take precedence over Preview's change notice; neither automatically replaces loaded content.
- **Text pages** — plain text, Markdown, and code read through an inject callback to `remote.workspaceFiles.read(sessionId, path, { offset }, signal)`. The first mount reads page one; scrolling to the body end or **Load more** requests the next page until `eof`. The owner delivers the accumulated prefix as `{ kind: 'text', text, pages, eof }`, including source offsets and line counts. Markdown and code render that prefix incrementally; they do not render each page as a separate document. A newer-version page past page one restarts from the beginning rather than mixing versions. A failure before any content fills the body with the file-type icon, explanation, and retry; a later failure retains loaded content and adds the retry below it.
- **Complete bytes** — PDF, HTML, and common images use an inject callback to `remote.workspaceFiles.readAll(sessionId, path, signal)`. `rpc.ts` decodes the wire base64 into `data: Uint8Array<ArrayBuffer>` for `{ kind: 'bytes', data }`. The Host's `maxFileBytes` cap rejects oversized files rather than truncating them. PDF copies retained bytes before worker transfer, keeping the Preview buffer usable. Bytes stay in transient view state, never persisted layouts or Session JSONL. Loading-mode changes retire previous results.
- **Reload** — only the current Preview tab rereads through its Remote callbacks, preserving its scroll preference and retiring older requests. Its change notice compares the read version and the observation captured at read start with later `resource.value.version`; an already observed version does not become a new change after refresh. Reads neither refresh shared metadata nor clear another tab's notice.

HTML fills the body edge to edge in a Blob iframe with exactly `sandbox="allow-scripts"`, without `allow-same-origin`; scripts cannot access the parent application's origin or file reader. The renderer loads directly declared relative `.js` classic scripts and `.css` stylesheets through its ordinary inject callback to `remote.workspaceFiles.readRelated`, with fixed safety limits of 4 MiB per asset, 32 MiB total, and 64 distinct assets. Host code resolves the related path; `rpc.ts` decodes the returned bytes. Inside the renderer, base64 is used only to embed the iframe bootstrap payload in script text. A `<base href>` leaves dependency resolution to the browser, as do HTTPS resources. Local module imports, CSS `url()`/`@import`, and dynamic `fetch` do not use Host file access. Read failures, invalid UTF-8, or exceeded limits fail the preview rather than publishing a partial asset package. Replacing or unmounting the document releases its Blob URL.

PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, ICO, and SVG render through Blob URLs in an `<img>` static-image context. The image keeps its intrinsic CSS-pixel dimensions; a smaller image centres in the shared scroller, and larger dimensions scroll on either axis. The renderer provides neither zoom nor drag-to-pan. SVG markup never enters the application DOM or an iframe, so its scripts cannot execute or reach the parent page. Replacing or unmounting the image revokes its Blob URL.

Shared copy comes from `sidebarDocumentPreview`; each builtin renderer owns its localized labels.

Initial reads, additional pages, and HTML/PDF/image preparation share a loading indicator that respects reduced-motion preferences. Loaded pages stay visible while another page loads. PDF pages form one vertical, width-fitted sequence and render lazily near the viewport. Code previews show source line numbers by default without including them in copied text; plain text uses the same font size and line height as code. Code sits on the pane's own background rather than the chat card's fill; its banner is adjacent to a full-height inner scrollport, so both scrollbars begin below the copy control.

<a id="navigation"></a>
## Navigation

`ctx.sidebarRight.openResource(address, { params: { line } })` carries a 1-based source line through the `file` parameters. In `text-pages` mode, the owner loads sequential pages until that line or EOF. Plain-text and code renderers expose source-line anchors; Markdown does not. A navigation remains pending while its selected renderer has no anchor and runs if the user switches to plain text or code. Code navigation scrolls the inner source viewport directly. Byte-mode renderers do not consume source-line navigation. Each completed navigation revision is answered once. Opening the same file without `revealIfOpened: false` focuses its existing tab and delivers a new revision.

<a id="model-experience"></a>
## Model Experience

None, as the preview is a browser-only viewer that registers no tool, prompt section, or session event.

#### KV Cache effect

No direct effect; what the user reads here never enters a model request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>
- **Preview, not editing.** The viewers provide no file editing or shared search interface; a directory address fails with `not-regular-file`. Unknown extensions use the plain-text reader and remain subject to its UTF-8/NUL checks.
- **Sequential text and bounded complete files.** Deep source lines require the preceding pages; PDF, HTML, and images require a complete result within the Host's `maxFileBytes` cap.
- **Byte-view scroll state is not restored.** PDF, HTML, and images can return to the top when their renderer remounts or reloads; image horizontal position is never restored, and HTML iframe scrolling belongs to its opaque browsing context.
- **Finite local HTML dependencies.** Only direct classic `.js` and stylesheet `.css` references are packed. Browser-resolved resources retain browser origin and network restrictions; no runtime file-read bridge is exposed to the iframe.
- **Package-local wrap glyphs.** `IconWrapFill16` and `IconNowrapFill16` live in `src/client/icons.tsx` until the shared icon set carries them; their props already match the shared icon contract.
- **Scroll writes are unthrottled.** Every scroll event records its offset in the store; the line blocks are memoized so the resulting re-render hands React the same elements back.

### Dev Note

<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

None.

</details>

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. Renderer metadata, document loading, and view state belong to the local registry and declared Slot stores, with no independent runtime source to compare against; registration disposal and tab lifetimes are covered by behavior tests.
