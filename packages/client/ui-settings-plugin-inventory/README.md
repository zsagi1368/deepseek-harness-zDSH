## Summary

The **Plugin list** tab lets Web users inspect plugins without changing their configuration. It lists agent presets, then the global inventory; both start collapsed and open on demand or during a search. Cards show localized titles and descriptions when available, identify instances by stable entry id, and expose enablement, source details, runtime status, disabled conditions, and discovery failures; preset-provided global entries name their presets. Search covers both groups and points to matches in other presets. The tab handles loading, empty, no-match, failure, and retry states without exposing transport details, and still shows the global inventory without a preset roster.

## Use this package

Open the Plugins section in Settings and select the **Plugin list** tab to inspect the Host's plugin inventory. The tab reads no Remote during plugin activation — selecting it for the first time mounts the component and lazily calls `ctx.remote.pluginInventory.list()` through `api-remotes`.

A failed installation with pending pnpm build permissions offers **Allow these scripts and retry**. The action displays the exact package names and persistent permission scope, then retries the original package spec and activation choice. One click approves the entire displayed group, which can include pending packages from earlier attempts. Closing the page grants no permission.

### Reading a card

Each collapsed card uses the plugin's localized title and description when available. Settings shortens literal package-name or module-name fallbacks by removing the npm scope and the `cordis:`, `cordis-plugin-`, or `dsh-`/`dsh-host-`/`dsh-client-` prefix; locale titles remain unchanged. The Host supplies locale and package-field fallbacks in `meta`; the Client selects the current language. Full module specifiers remain available in details and search. Missing descriptions are omitted, and metadata diagnostics appear with the card. This compact naming applies only to Settings, not the sidebar's Plugins page.

The stable entry id appears underneath the title, alongside a small enablement tag; a colored root-fiber status dot marks only the phases the tag cannot state: `pending` maps to idle, while `loading` and `unloading` map to ongoing. An `active` or `failed` fiber shows its tag without a dot. A composition-generated subtitle omits its leading `include:` marker, while hover, search, the accessible name, and expanded details retain the complete id. Long entry ids truncate in the row and remain available on hover. Expanding one card reveals the declared entry id, the full module specifier, and the state facts: a preset row names the preset it comes from, its runtime status when the composition is live, and its disable condition when it carries one; a preset-provided global row explains that agent presets provide it per session, names the presets that enable it, and offers a jump into the preset group. Preset names resolve through the shared `presetDisplayText` fold (`dsh-agent-preset-registry/display`) over [`ui-agent-preset`](../ui-agent-preset/README.md)'s dictionaries: shipped presets follow the active locale while user-authored ones keep their own metadata, so an English surface never echoes the preset declarations' Chinese names. Search filters both groups by localized title and description, module name, and entry id.

### The preset switcher

The switcher is the same selector-pill-plus-menu control the General settings rows use. It lists every roster preset — the default suffixed as such, broken ones marked — and changes only what the list shows: it writes no settings, and selecting a broken preset shows the discovery-reported reason in place of rows. Choosing the default preset or a session's preset stays where it was: the Agent presets section and the new-session screen.

### Retrying a failed read

A failed read renders the shared error marker inside the tab; loading and current-page synchronization use the shared ongoing loader. Retrying re-runs the lazy `list()` call without exposing transport details.

The Plugin list also shows synchronization failures on the current page. Its retry reapplies the latest client graph without changing Host enablement or refreshing the page.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The tab is a read-only projection of a Host-owned snapshot; it performs no Remote read during plugin activation and takes the snapshot on first selection.

### Registration

The browser plugin registers one localized `settings.plugins.tab` contribution with id `all`; the Plugins section owns the navigation entry and tab chrome. Registration uses `ctx.slots.inject()`, so it follows late tab declaration, redeclaration, locale changes, and teardown without importing the section owner.

### Rendering

Row keys are scope-qualified (`global:`, `preset:<id>:<index>`), so one module appearing in both scopes keeps distinct disclosure state; a declared entry id appears in expanded details and supplies the collapsed subtitle after removal of a leading composition `include:` marker, while a row without one stays unlabeled. The preset-provided marking is derived client-side: a global entry carries it when it is disabled there while at least one preset row for the same module specifier is actually enabled, so a module every preset gates off (or declares only conditionally) stays plainly disabled rather than over-claiming provision.

## Further Exploration

These pages cover the settings section, the remote call, and the Host-side projection.

- [ui-settings-plugins](../ui-settings-plugins/README.md) — the Plugins section this tab registers into.
- [ui-settings](../ui-settings/README.md) — the domain base declaring `settings.plugins.tab`.
- [api-remotes](../../api/remotes/README.md) — the Remote BFF surface behind `pluginInventory.list()`.
- [plugin-inventory](../../host/plugin-inventory/README.md) — the Host-side read-only Loader projection this tab renders.

<a id="model-experience"></a>
## Model Experience

None, as the package is a browser-side inventory projection that registers nothing model-facing.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define the freshness and reach of the inventory view; they are current package constraints.

- **One snapshot per Settings mount or retry** — the tab does not subscribe to Loader changes or automatically refetch after reconnect; switching tabs preserves the current snapshot, while reopening Settings obtains a new one.
- **Read-only in both planes** — the tab shows global and preset enablement but mutates neither; enable/disable controls that write a custom preset's own composition file are deliberate follow-up work.

None.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. This package owns a read-only Settings contribution.
