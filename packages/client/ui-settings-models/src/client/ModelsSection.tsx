/**
 * Models settings section: the provider rows joined from the configurable
 * directory, settings namespaces, and credential states, with one editor
 * card at a time. Rows retain the account-first order supplied by the store
 * and expose only confirmed API-key state through accessible
 * solid configured or missing dots. A whole-section provider without a
 * configured key renders as its open setup card instead of a row, but only in
 * the first-run posture — no provider on the page can serve requests yet — and
 * only until the user closes that card. The add flow is one card behind one
 * button: a mode switch chooses between adopting a dormant directory provider
 * (the catalog select over the provider editor) and declaring a custom model
 * API (the create form). A panel mounts the first time its mode is shown and
 * stays mounted, hidden, while the card is open and its mode stays offered,
 * so switching modes discards neither draft and an unvisited mode costs
 * nothing; the switch holds still while either panel has a write or an
 * endpoint interrogation in flight, since a switch underneath one would
 * orphan the answer. Each card kind owns its own open state, so closing one
 * never discards a draft in another. Every
 * mutation writes through the wire, while a provider removal first requires
 * confirmation; the page re-renders from pushed invalidations or the
 * post-apply reload.
