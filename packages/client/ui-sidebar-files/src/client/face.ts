/**
 * The tree's asynchronous half: listing directories into the store.
 *
 * The component never awaits anything. It calls `start` / `load` / `toggle`, and
 * this face performs the listing and writes the outcome through the store's own
 * actions — the Slot-standard `inject` shape, so the session id is resolved by
 * the framework and the write set stays the store's.
 *
 * The listing itself is bound here to the Client Remote face: the tree keys
 * every level by absolute path and hands the endpoint that same absolute path;
 * the endpoint answers with the directory's workspace-relative path as well,
 * which the tree has no use for and drops.
 *
 * One level has one listing in force: asking for a level again — the reload
 * gesture, a directory reopened after a reset — retires the listing still in
 * flight for it, whose settlement then writes nothing. Cleanup rides the owner's
 * `signal`: a request is not made for a record that already ended, and when the
 * record goes away the bucket and the tab's listing bookkeeping are forgotten,
 * so no later settlement writes to it.
