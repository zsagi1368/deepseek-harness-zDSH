/**
 * Synchronous atomic ledger write (TC-B4-H1 face 4 = FB5 settlement; D1b
 * §3-FB5: the durable ledgers were written with a direct `writeFileSync` —
 * a crash mid-write corrupted the file into the loader's fail-open empty
 * shape (a lost `userUninstalled` tombstone resurrects a removed preinstall
 * on the next boot), and lock-free readers could observe half-written JSON
 * across processes).
 *
 * Why NOT the in-repo `@deepseek-ai/dsh-atomic-write` `writeFileAtomic`
 * itself (errata 1/2, RECEIPT-H1 §2.2): ① that API is async while this
 * package's ledger commits sit on synchronous contract faces (`approve()` is
 * a sync `@Remote` with a sync compensation try/catch; the executor's
 * `recordProvenance` hook is sync) — async-izing them would extend the
 * published `@Remote` signatures (a contract-face change this card must not
 * make); ② the kernel package carries a "zero new dependencies, node
 * builtins only" discipline and has its own file-local mirror of this shape.
 *
 * Semantics mirror `writeFileAtomic` point by point
 * (atomic-write/src/index.ts:78-93 + renameAtomicTemp): random-suffix
 * sibling temp opened with exclusive create (`wx` — refuses to follow a
 * symlink planted at the temp path), the caller's mode stamped on the fresh
 * inode and carried through the rename, atomic rename commit (lock-free
 * readers observe either the old or the new complete content — the
 * atomic-write module-head protocol "readers stay lock-free because the
 * rename commit is atomic" is what this restores), bounded backoff retries
 * of transient win32 `EACCES`/`EBUSY`/`EPERM` rename failures (20ms doubling
 * to 200ms, 8 attempts), and temp cleanup + rethrow on any remaining failure.
 * Crash durability (fsync) stays out of scope exactly as the package
 * protocol states.
 * @module @deepseek-ai/dsh-plugin-governance-host/src/atomic-write-sync
