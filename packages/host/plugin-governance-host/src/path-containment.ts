/**
 * Path-containment guards for untrusted declarative inputs (TC-B4-H1 face 6;
 * D1a F7 [建议] + D1b §4 F7 主判定: the seed file is an UNTRUSTED declarative
 * document — its field whitelist already denies by default, and this module
 * extends the same posture to path semantics).
 *
 * Shape: the filehub `isStrictlyInside` equivalent form (D1a :207 reusable-
 * fix provenance): `resolve` + `relative` + reject `''` (equal-root) + reject
 * `..` segments + reject `isAbsolute(rel)` (cross-drive on win32). Deliberately
 * NOT `startsWith` — the zdsh-security-patterns segment-comparison trap
 * (`C:\repo` vs `C:\repo-evil` prefix collision) is immune by construction
 * with the relative form.
 *
 * Junction/symlink mine (the third patterns trap): a textual-inside path whose
 * link body redirects OUT of the root is re-checked through
 * `realpathSync.native` on BOTH sides (same-coordinate-system discipline, the
 * path-guard shape). Erratum vs the report prose (RECEIPT-H1 §2.5 勘误4):
 * D1a/D1b suggested "lstat rejects symlink/junction bodies" — landing that
 * literally would false-kill all seven factory rows, whose bundle
 * `node_modules` entries ARE pnpm junctions (D1b §4.2 self-evidence). The
 * normalized-containment form keeps the junction mine locked (a link escaping
 * the root fails) while in-root pnpm junctions pass — the G1 "junction with a
 * single in-root target = normal" philosophy, and the K-1.2.1 zero-false-kill
 * discipline for the factory seven.
