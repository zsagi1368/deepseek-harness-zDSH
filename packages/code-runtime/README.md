# code-runtime/ — code-execution capability family

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `code-runtime/` group lets a model write one program that calls host-provided functions as ordinary async calls, then returns only the program's printed output and return value. Choose the TypeScript backend for execution in an isolated Node worker, or the experimental Python backend when a CPython process is required. Each run starts without state from earlier programs. Failures are returned as results so callers can diagnose them or provide them to the model.

## Packages

These three packages together provide program execution; each README describes what its part does.

| Package | Role | ctx key |
|---|---|---|
| [`code-runtime/`](code-runtime/README.md) | Defines what a code runtime does: run one program against host-provided bindings and report what it printed and returned | `ctx.codeRuntime` |
| [`code-runtime-worker-thread/`](code-runtime-worker-thread/README.md) | Executes TypeScript programs, each in a fresh Node worker thread | registers `ctx.codeRuntime` |
| [`experimental/code-runtime-python/`](../experimental/code-runtime-python/README.md) | The experimental Python backend: owns the fd-3 wire protocol between a Node host and a CPython subprocess and the CPython runtime implementation | — |

- [PTC mode Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-06-15-ptc.md) — how the tool registry presents `run_code` to the model.
