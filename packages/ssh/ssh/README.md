English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`dsh-ssh` connects a POSIX Harness host to an installed helper on a POSIX SSH host. One deployment-owned OpenSSH alias supplies authentication and host identity; the paired filesystem, subprocess and sandbox providers use that connection. The connection verifies installed artifact digests before readiness; the helper owns remote cleanup when the connection closes or its lease expires.

## Use this package

Compose this service with [`fs-ssh`](../fs-ssh/README.md), [`subprocess-ssh`](../subprocess-ssh/README.md) and [`sandbox-ssh`](../sandbox-ssh/README.md) in a custom `dsh` profile. The host runs the Harness, model transport and Session storage; the remote machine supplies the files and processes. Headless profiles support this arrangement.

### Deployment prerequisites

Both endpoints require Linux or macOS. The local `ssh` command must support connection multiplexing and Unix-socket forwarding; the server must permit that forwarding. Configure the alias, credentials and known-host entry before startup: the service enables `BatchMode`, requires strict host-key checking, disables agent forwarding and adds no interactive authentication flow.

Install the built helper and its matching runtime dependencies on the remote host. Keep Node, helper, bootstrap and their dependencies outside the workspace and writable temporary roots. They must also remain outside a backend’s replaced temporary tree, such as bwrap’s private `/tmp`; the workspace may still be under `/tmp`. Digest verification detects an unexpected installed artifact after helper startup; it does not make writable deployment files safe to execute or authenticate a malicious SSH host.

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | required | Existing OpenSSH host alias |
| `node`, `helper`, `workspace` | required | Absolute remote Node executable, bundled helper entry and default workspace |
| `helperHash` | required | Lowercase SHA-256 of the installed helper entry |
| `bootstrapPath`, `bootstrapHash` | omitted | Paired remote PTC entry and its lowercase SHA-256 |
| `requestTimeoutMs` | `30000` | Connection and administrative-request deadline, from 1 through 2,147,483,647 ms |
| `maxFrameBytes` | `67108864` | Per-message JSON payload ceiling, at most 64 MiB |
| `maxPending` | `128` | Ordinary outstanding requests; heartbeat and bounded cleanup requests have reserved capacity |
| `leaseMs` | `30000` | Helper heartbeat lease, from 3000 to 600000 ms |

For PTC, configure both bootstrap fields and pass the verified `ctx.ssh.nodeExecutable` and `ctx.ssh.bootstrapPath` to [`NodePtcRuntime`](../../ptc-runtime/ptc-runtime-node/README.md). Basic filesystem and Bash use may omit the pair. The `bootstrapPath` getter refuses an unconfigured PTC deployment.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The OpenSSH master carries private administrative RPC. Each program stream uses a separate forwarded Unix socket and an independent SSH channel. Program stdout cannot forge administrative replies or occupy the control stream’s channel window. SSH transport congestion still affects the shared connection.

Each stream reservation has a random 256-bit TLS pre-shared key carried only by administrative RPC. TLS authenticates both endpoints and protects every stream byte; the key is never sent as a stream preface. Socket directories are private (`0700`) and sockets use `0600`. Replacing a writable socket path cannot impersonate an endpoint or reveal the stream key; an attacker can still interrupt service or relay opaque TLS records.

Connection disposal joins forwarding and cancellation subprocesses and partially established streams before removing local resources. Transport loss rejects pending operations and invalidates the connection. The helper starts managed cleanup on SSH EOF, termination signals or heartbeat expiry. A disconnected client cannot confirm the remote outcome; operations are never reconnected or replayed automatically.

Failed startup and process results release their reservations after native quiescence; the bounded completion cache preserves the original rejection for later result reads. Helper shutdown also joins endpoint and directory cleanup already in progress.

For terminals opting into shell activity observation, root exit retains the reservation and its remaining work. Activity RPC continues to reach the provider; explicit termination awaits quiescence before releasing endpoints and recording the completed result. Helper connection disposal and lease expiry retain their existing termination authority.

The helper starts with `--disable-sigusr1`, so a same-user process signal cannot open its Node debugger.

## Model Experience

None, as host aliases, authentication and stream capabilities are private deployment details and consumers own every model-visible operation.

#### KV Cache effect

This provider contributes no request-prefix content. Its consumers own model-visible tools and results.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- No Windows endpoint, automatic provisioning, reconnect or replay is supplied.
- Web workspace UI paths still assume host filesystem access; use headless or a custom composition whose consumers honor provider paths.
- TLS stream keys do not protect against remote OS process-memory inspection or debugging. File-effect policy retains the selected sandbox backend’s limits.

### Dev Note

<details>
<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

No invariant companion is published. Wire validation and the owning filesystem, subprocess and sandbox providers enforce the observable obligations; this adapter adds no independently observed state relation.
