# apps/web browser e2e

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

These tests boot the real web composition in-process and drive it with real browsers over real HTTP. Chromium runs the full lane; the [model and reasoning picker scenario](declared-reasoning.e2e.ts) also runs in WebKit to cover native mouse focus behavior. The lane's mechanics — modes, fixtures, goldens, and the deliberate composition divergences from `dsh web` — are documented in [`scaffold.ts`](scaffold.ts) and the [browser e2e Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/testing/2026-07-24-web-gui-browser-e2e-lane.md).

After installing workspace dependencies, install the browsers and their system dependencies from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm --filter @deepseek-ai/dsh-web-frontend exec playwright install --with-deps chromium webkit
```

On Linux, `--with-deps` installs dependencies through the system package manager. The persistent CI VM must provide these dependencies through image maintenance; CI installs only the browser binaries, as required by the [failover runbook](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-07-26-ci-failover-runbook.md).

Ordinary scenarios begin with no registered Workspace or Session and a durable marker recording a removed default Workspace, so explicit folder-selection scenarios retain control of their cwd. `launchWebScaffold({ firstUse: true })` leaves initialization eligible for startup scenarios.

## Completion observations

State-sensitive cases use Workspace, admission, attachment, and model-stream barriers to separate visible intermediate states from completed operations. Model-picker persistence assertions wait for the saved default, independently of menu closure. Details close waits for frame transitions; archive verification assigns an explicit title to the seeded Session and follows that identity across reload. See the [CI fixture synchronization decision](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/testing/2026-09-08-ci-completion-observations.md).

Explicit scrolling uses `scrollIntoView` from `support.ts`: it resolves the locator again when its old element detaches and checks connection in the same browser task as native scrolling. Scenarios retain their visibility and geometry assertions after scrolling.

## These are Host-face tests

They type-check in the root `tsconfig.host.json`, not in the Client aggregate, because they read Host services directly: `ctx.connection`, the Host `SessionStore`, and `ctx.sessionProjectionCache`. Driving a browser at runtime does not make a file part of the Client program — the two faces merge Cordis `Context` under the same keys with different services, so one program cannot see both. Moving these files into the Client aggregate makes every Host-service access fail to compile.

## Do not import `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-*` here

Importing a Client package — a value or a type — pulls its whole TypeScript project, and every project it references, into the **Host build graph**. That has bitten this lane once already: four Client consumer packages reference `api/remotes`' Client face, which cannot compile until Host tsdown has generated `@deepseek-ai/dsh-goal/remote`, so the Host build phase ended up waiting on an artifact it produces itself.

When a scenario needs a Client-owned constant or pure function, mirror it here instead, next to the commented-out import that names the source module. A drift then surfaces as a missed selector or a stale mirrored value — a loud failure, never a silent pass. `scaffold.ts` follows this rule for the welcome-notice namespace, acknowledgement field, version, and asserted Chinese copy.

The built-client harness is the exception. `assembled-boot.ts` imports `AppWebEntry`, the boot-manifest type, and `RemoteMock`; `assembled-remote.ts` imports the Client test runtime's default responses and `RemoteMock`. These packages are explicit project references for booting the real shell against a test-owned carrier. The chat scenarios mirror `conversationContextKey` in `support.ts` instead of importing its Client owner.

Nothing mechanically enforces this rule; keep it in review.
