English | [中文](README.zh.md)

The `./landlock-run` entry exports the Landlock launcher path, enforcement probe, grant arguments, and protocol constants. The independent `./flock` entry exports `tryLockExclusive(fd): Promise<void>`; importing either entry does not load `system.node`. The package has no root export.

The lock operation attempts `LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB` asynchronously. Keep the caller-owned descriptor open until completion; contention rejects with `EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK`, other syscall failures also reject, and errors carry their code, positive errno, and `syscall: 'flock'`. Native setup errors reject the same promise. Closing the last descriptor for the open file description releases the lock. The binding does not open, duplicate, close, or explicitly unlock descriptors.

Optional OS/CPU platform packages carry the binaries. Linux has `bin/landlock-run` and separate `bin/glibc/system.node` / `bin/musl/system.node`; macOS has `bin/system.node`. Missing or unloadable flock bindings reject acquisition, without installation-time compilation. Landlock remains a separate executable with its existing fail-closed protocol; unsupported kernels/platforms probe unusable.

The two C sources ship for auditability. See the workspace [architecture](../../docs/architecture.md), [support matrix](../../docs/support-matrix.md), and [CLI contract](../../docs/cli-contract.md).
